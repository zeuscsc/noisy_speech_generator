00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.640
apply for a credit card. In

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.640
1958, the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.880
first credit card with a revolving credit loan function,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.440
BankAmericard, was born, which

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.440
is the predecessor of Visa Card.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.160
On the surface, this card brings convenience to modern people. You

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.080
can buy now and pay later with a simple scan.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.080
But when you open the package, you will find that it

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.680
is actually a financial product full of traps.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.240
Of course, are the big credit card companies

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.600
running charity organizations?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.920
In order to win our favor, a credit card

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.920
offers welcome gifts,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.200
cash rebates, and

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.920
various discounts.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.400
How can they earn our money by spending money like this?

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.400
For credit card companies,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.680
there are two kinds of people in this world:

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.040
those who owe money at the end of the month, which is in disguise of borrowing money, and

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.400
those who pay off their credit cards in full at the end of the month.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.360
In foreign countries, there is a special term for these people:

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.480
Deadbeats.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.160
You need to make sure that you have never paid a penny of interest
