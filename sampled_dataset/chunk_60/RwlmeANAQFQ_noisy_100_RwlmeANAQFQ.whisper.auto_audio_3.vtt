00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Because we also noticed that China seems to be trying to address the issue with both the demand side and supply side.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
On the demand side, its pivot towards stimulating consumption might be one way.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Also start to talk about sector-specific measures in order to cut the capacity.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And as you said, it may be restrict the export.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Does the outbound of the Iraq investment also play a role?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I think outbound direct investment is very much encouraged by the rest of the world,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
well, with the exception of countries that don't welcome Chinese money, which is, I think, is not not smart.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
But, you know, that's the fact.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
If you look at around the developing world, actually, in the world today, there's a massive deficit in investment.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Agri-investment in the world is down, especially to developing countries.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And some countries needs to fill that gap.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I think China is very just doing so by not only investing, but maybe bringing some of its technology,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.000
but it really need to obviously help the local economy build its own economy on its own feet.
