So for investors, at least from what I'm observing, if I were an investor, I think about being in both camps, if I can, to the extent possible.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Because there'll be some that will be successful in China and the US.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And you just don't know, you don't know which one, because both have its respective advantages.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
But it's also, on a more sanguine note, it's also less likely that they're going to converge rather than move in parallel.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Thanks for sitting down with us and discuss all those interesting issues today.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Hope to see you again in the near future. Thanks.
