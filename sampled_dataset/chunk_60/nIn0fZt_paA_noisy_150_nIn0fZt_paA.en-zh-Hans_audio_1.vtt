How do credit card companies with endless discounts make money from us?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.480
And how can we make

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.440
money back from credit cards?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.000
Remember that the Shifu teaching series

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.840
will have a new look

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.760
and you will see more new faces of colleagues behind the scenes. We

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.040
strive to continue to present the knowledge of financial management and investment to everyone in a more down-to-earth way.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.000

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.040

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.280
I hope everyone will support us.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.080
YouTube's algorithm is getting harder and harder to play.

A convenient credit card

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.560
is a nightmare for many people. Four

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.000
out of ten Americans

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.840
have a lot of credit card debt,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.800
and one in

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.600
ten of them will never be able to pay it off in their lifetime. In

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.680
Hong Kong, 60% of people

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.760
have at least three credit cards. In the
