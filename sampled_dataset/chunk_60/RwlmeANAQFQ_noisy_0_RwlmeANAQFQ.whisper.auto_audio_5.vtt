00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So if you look at its export share of GDP, it's actually falling over time and converging to the US and Europe,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
which means that it's absorbing more of its own goods.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And I think that's just a trend that it will continue.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I think they just need to think about whether I still come back to this model issue,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
because just 80 cities in China do 80 cities really all need to do EVs.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Do they all need to do solar panels because it's a policy?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So there is too much competition because there's a lot of resources developing on one thing.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So rather than doing the same thing, they should find how to do complementary things as well.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So there are lots of things in the economy that can still be adjusted to address this problem.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
There seem to be a lot of focus on stimulating domestic demand in particular on consumption side.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And actually just several days after the National People's Congress, China rose out a very comprehensive plan on stimulating the consumption.
