00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But they really should be spending more on social services to give the boost in demand.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And also, Chinese companies are really competitive.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And it has very little to do with subsidies.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
If you look at majority of manufacturing, 90% of manufacturing companies,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
there is no over investment.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Actually, it is responding to market forces.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The 10% is some of the new sectors.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But in general, that's going to cause tension.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The fact that China absolutely dominates so much in manufacturing is going to be a problem for other developing countries.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I think there will be a backlash until they structure that, they redress that imbalance.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And how to do that?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Well, I mean, the easiest way is still coming back to domestic demand.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But maybe they need to have some voluntary restraints on exports as well.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That's a very interesting point you are mentioning.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Because we also noticed that China seems to be trying to address the issue with both the demand side and supply side.
