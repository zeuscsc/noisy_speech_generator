00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.560
same sentence.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.480
There are advantages and disadvantages to using a credit card. There

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.680
is a price behind the discounts and numbers.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.080
But you have Diao Chan and

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.080
I also have Xiao Erqiao.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.680
We are not necessarily just being exploited by credit cards.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.480
We can all take the initiative to make good use of credit cards. The

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.080
key lies in how you use it. I do

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.480
nâ€™t want everyone to turn off the screen after watching the video

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.280
and pretend nothing happened,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.680
so I specifically want to give you three steps.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.480
Everyone go back and do your homework.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.400
First, count how many credit cards you have. Do

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400
you know

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.600
how much your total credit limit is?

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.200
Second, after reading the credit card monthly statement for the most recent month,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.800
what are your spending habits like? Do you have any outstanding balances?

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.200

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.600
I believe there will be surprises.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.800
Third, what was the reason for applying for different credit cards in the first place? Is

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.600

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.400
this reason still valid? Do you

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.200
need to cancel the card? If you

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.800
have done your homework,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.720
you are welcome to
