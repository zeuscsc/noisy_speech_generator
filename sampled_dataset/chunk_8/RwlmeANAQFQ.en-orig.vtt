00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
like a big and rich country. So if you
 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.629 align:start position:0%
like a big and rich country. So if you
if<00:05:01.280><c> you</c><00:05:01.440><c> look</c><00:05:01.600><c> at</c><00:05:01.759><c> its</c><00:05:02.000><c> export</c><00:05:02.560><c> share</c><00:05:03.120><c> of</c><00:05:03.440><c> GDP,</c>

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
if you look at its export share of GDP,
 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.749 align:start position:0%
if you look at its export share of GDP,
it's<00:05:04.960><c> actually</c><00:05:05.639><c> falling</c><00:05:06.800><c> uh</c><00:05:06.960><c> over</c><00:05:07.199><c> time</c><00:05:07.440><c> and</c>

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
it's actually falling uh over time and
 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.150 align:start position:0%
it's actually falling uh over time and
converging<00:05:08.320><c> to</c><00:05:08.560><c> the</c><00:05:08.800><c> US</c><00:05:09.199><c> and</c><00:05:09.600><c> Europe,</c><00:05:09.919><c> which</c>

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
converging to the US and Europe, which
 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.270 align:start position:0%
converging to the US and Europe, which
means<00:05:10.400><c> that</c><00:05:10.639><c> it's</c><00:05:10.880><c> absorbing</c><00:05:12.240><c> um</c><00:05:12.560><c> more</c><00:05:12.800><c> of</c><00:05:13.039><c> its</c>

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
means that it's absorbing um more of its
 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.270 align:start position:0%
means that it's absorbing um more of its

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
own uh own goods. And I think that's
 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.830 align:start position:0%
own uh own goods. And I think that's

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
just a trend that it will continue. Um,
 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.990 align:start position:0%
just a trend that it will continue. Um,
I<00:05:18.080><c> think</c><00:05:18.160><c> they</c><00:05:18.400><c> just</c><00:05:18.560><c> need</c><00:05:18.720><c> to</c><00:05:18.880><c> think</c><00:05:19.120><c> about</c>

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
I think they just need to think about
 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.550 align:start position:0%
I think they just need to think about
whether<00:05:20.880><c> I</c><00:05:21.199><c> I</c><00:05:21.440><c> still</c><00:05:21.600><c> come</c><00:05:21.840><c> back</c><00:05:22.000><c> to</c><00:05:22.160><c> this</c>

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
whether I I still come back to this
 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.990 align:start position:0%
whether I I still come back to this

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.230 align:start position:0%

cities<00:05:26.400><c> in</c><00:05:26.639><c> China,</c><00:05:27.039><c> do</c><00:05:27.199><c> 80</c><00:05:27.520><c> cities</c><00:05:27.759><c> really</c><00:05:28.000><c> all</c>

need to do EVs, you know? Um, do they
 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.830 align:start position:0%
need to do EVs, you know? Um, do they

all need to do uh uh solar panels
 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.550 align:start position:0%
all need to do uh uh solar panels
because<00:05:34.080><c> it's</c><00:05:34.240><c> a</c><00:05:34.440><c> policy?</c><00:05:35.440><c> So</c><00:05:35.840><c> there</c><00:05:36.160><c> is</c><00:05:36.320><c> too</c>

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
because it's a policy? So there is too
 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.150 align:start position:0%
because it's a policy? So there is too
much<00:05:36.720><c> competition</c><00:05:37.360><c> because</c><00:05:37.600><c> there's</c><00:05:37.919><c> a</c><00:05:38.080><c> lot</c>

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
much competition because there's a lot
 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.150 align:start position:0%
much competition because there's a lot

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
of resources to vote on one thing. So
 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.749 align:start position:0%
of resources to vote on one thing. So
rather<00:05:40.479><c> than</c><00:05:40.639><c> doing</c><00:05:40.800><c> the</c><00:05:41.039><c> same</c><00:05:41.280><c> thing,</c><00:05:41.520><c> they</c>

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
rather than doing the same thing, they
 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.070 align:start position:0%
rather than doing the same thing, they
can<00:05:42.000><c> they</c><00:05:42.240><c> can</c><00:05:42.400><c> they</c><00:05:42.639><c> should</c><00:05:42.800><c> find</c><00:05:43.360><c> how</c><00:05:43.520><c> to</c><00:05:43.759><c> do</c>

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
can they can they should find how to do
 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.790 align:start position:0%
can they can they should find how to do

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
children then they can pretty much
 

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.670 align:start position:0%
children then they can pretty much
choose<00:10:25.760><c> wherever</c><00:10:26.240><c> their</c><00:10:26.720><c> kids</c><00:10:27.040><c> go</c><00:10:27.200><c> to</c><00:10:27.440><c> school</c>

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.910 align:start position:0%
choose wherever their kids go to school
so<00:10:28.160><c> it's</c><00:10:28.480><c> also</c><00:10:28.720><c> a</c><00:10:28.880><c> big</c><00:10:29.120><c> step</c><00:10:29.279><c> for</c><00:10:29.519><c> Chinese</c>

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
so it's also a big step for Chinese
 

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.550 align:start position:0%
so it's also a big step for Chinese
government<00:10:30.240><c> to</c><00:10:30.480><c> start</c><00:10:30.880><c> subsidize</c><00:10:31.839><c> the</c><00:10:32.160><c> child</c>

uh uh free up some resources for demand.
So<00:11:02.000><c> I</c><00:11:02.160><c> think</c><00:11:02.320><c> lots</c><00:11:02.560><c> of</c><00:11:02.640><c> lessons</c><00:11:02.959><c> to</c><00:11:03.120><c> be</c><00:11:03.279><c> learned</c>

So I think lots of lessons to be learned
 

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.590 align:start position:0%
So I think lots of lessons to be learned
from<00:11:03.680><c> those</c><00:11:03.839><c> countries.</c><00:11:04.560><c> Do</c><00:11:04.800><c> you</c><00:11:04.959><c> think</c><00:11:05.440><c> um</c>

you know what type of structural reform
would<00:11:08.079><c> be</c><00:11:08.240><c> necessary</c><00:11:08.880><c> in</c><00:11:09.120><c> order</c><00:11:09.360><c> to</c><00:11:10.000><c> uh</c><00:11:10.160><c> push</c>

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
would be necessary in order to uh push
 

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.430 align:start position:0%
would be necessary in order to uh push
China<00:11:11.440><c> to</c><00:11:11.760><c> make</c><00:11:11.920><c> those</c><00:11:12.240><c> changes?</c><00:11:12.800><c> Like</c><00:11:13.040><c> in</c><00:11:13.200><c> the</c>
