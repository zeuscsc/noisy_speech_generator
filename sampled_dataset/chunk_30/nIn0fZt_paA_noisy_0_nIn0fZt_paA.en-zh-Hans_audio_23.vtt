00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.480
first thing everyone should know is that

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.600
a healthy credit record

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.920
means not using more than 30% of the credit limit

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.520
and repaying on time every month.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.760
Credit score may not be of much use to you today,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.320

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.080
but if you

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.520
plan to do a mortgage or do business in the future and suddenly

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.400
need

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.520
money to turn around,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.120
how much you can borrow, what the interest rate is,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.720
or even whether you can borrow at all?

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.040
Credit score is absolutely the key role  There is more than one way

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.840
to prove that an institution is worthy of lending you money.
