00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.040
our daily lives, we

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.800
have actually fallen into the trap when we use

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.880
credit cards to make purchases. But even when faced with the traps set by credit card companies,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.960

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.320
we have ways

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.720
to crack the merchants' tricks.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.040
I believe everyone has a card in hand.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.040
No matter how good your investment is, the

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.120
wrong use of credit cards

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.920
can destroy the wealth you have worked hard to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.720
build. In

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.280
this episode, let's talk about the price

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.360
behind the convenience of credit cards.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.960

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.320

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.080
How do credit card companies with endless discounts make money from us?
