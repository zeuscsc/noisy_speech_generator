And there is sufficient demand if urbanization can continue and rural population can be properly integrated into the formal economy.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.000
But also, I still think that there are challenges because local governments, they operate in their own kind of autonomous sort of way,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
like any other government they care about social stability.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Maybe this is very politically incorrect to mention this, but it's kind of like the immigration issue, right?
