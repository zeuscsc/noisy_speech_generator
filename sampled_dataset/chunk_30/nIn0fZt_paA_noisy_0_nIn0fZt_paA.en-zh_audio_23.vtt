00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.480
first thing you need to know is that

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.600
a healthy credit record

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.920
means not using more than 30

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.520
% of your credit limit and making repayments on time every month. Your

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.760
credit score

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.320
may not be very useful to you today,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.080
but it will be very useful to you in the future. If you

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.520
plan to take out a mortgage or start a business, and

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.400
suddenly something happens and you need

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.520
money urgently,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.120

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120
how much you can borrow, what the interest rate will be,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.720
or even if you can borrow at all?

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.040
Credit score is definitely a key role. There is more than one way

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.840
to prove that an institution is worthy of lending you money.
