Start to complain about China is getting too competitive in it export.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And some people are saying that China is exporting deflation.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Apparently, especially with the US China trade tension, some other economies start to worry about.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They might see more inflow of Chinese goods that could, to some extent,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
put some pressure on their domestic manufacturing.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So what's your review on this?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I do believe that there is a structural issue at heart that needs to be solved over time for the benefit of China for the rest of the world.
