So when these non-English speakers were introduced to Standard English, they influenced English with their own native languages, molding it into what we know today as Singlish.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Like any other language, Singlish has its own sets of rules and vocabulary.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You can use Singlish to get your points across faster with lesser words.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
For example, in Standard English you would say,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Seems like it is going to rain today. I think it would be best for you to bring an umbrella out.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Which comes to a total of 21 words.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Whereas, when you use Singlish, you could say,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm gonna rain now, bring an umbrella out.
