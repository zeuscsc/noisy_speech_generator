00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.240
when the Spaniards invaded Philippines in the 1500s.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.520
That is why many of us Pilipinos have Spanish last names like Bustos.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.000
My full name is Michael Jan Yadantumangil PestaÃ±o Bustos.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760
Try saying that 5 times.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.400
Also worth noting, there's no TH.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.080
It's either D sound like that, this, there, them, breathe,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.920
or T sound like tik, tit, binit, tissel, bret.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.520
Also, another thing to note is that the Filipino language

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.560
lacks the he, she distinct pronouns.
