00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.560
lacks the he, she distinct pronouns.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.800
It's only one in Pilipino, SIA.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.040
That is why many Pilipinos sometimes get he and she mixed up.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.520
Little bit confused.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.880
I like Ricky Martin.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.720
Her music is very good.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.280
Also, because Philippines is a third world,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.880
social class even determines the way you speak English.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.360
The socialites say words like promise,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.320
forever.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.400
Correct, true, kadiri to death.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.000
When I go to Philippines, I love watching TV and all the funny advertisements.
