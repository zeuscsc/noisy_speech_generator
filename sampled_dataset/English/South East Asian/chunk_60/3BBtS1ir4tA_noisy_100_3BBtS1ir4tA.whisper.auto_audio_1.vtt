00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.560
lacks the he, she distinct pronouns.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.800
It's only one in Pilipino, SIA.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.040
That is why many Pilipinos sometimes get he and she mixed up.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.520
Little bit confused.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.880
I like Ricky Martin.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.720
Her music is very good.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.280
Also, because Philippines is a third world,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.880
social class even determines the way you speak English.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.360
The socialites say words like promise,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.320
forever.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.400
Correct, true, kadiri to death.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.000
When I go to Philippines, I love watching TV and all the funny advertisements.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.120
Kuya, germs!

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.840
Hindi ah!

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.200
Ako, dandrap!

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.400
Use head and shoulders, kaya head and scalp healthy.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.000
70 pesos lang.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.360
People ask me why I am able to speak like this.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.640
And I tell them, even though I was born in Canada,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.680
I used to speak like this when I was very small.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.760
I learned English from my parents.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.320
Pero, but, in grade 4, I learned to speak with a proper accent

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.360
so that I could fit in and the kids wouldn't make fun of me.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.680
But, I never lost it.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.200
Anyway, there are 171 native languages in Philippines.
