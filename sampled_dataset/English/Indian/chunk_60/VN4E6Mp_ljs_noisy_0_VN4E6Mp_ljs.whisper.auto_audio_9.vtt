00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Here it means that the valve opening is going to see how fast the deviation is happening.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
See rate of deviation.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
That means how fast the deviation is happening.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So it is predictive in nature.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
On the basis of this prediction, this valve will continue to open more than what the P action

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
would have done.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It is anticipating a big drop in level.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:29.000
The outcome of this derivative action is that the stability point with or without offset

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
is achieved quickly.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So we can also think it like this.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000
You see here, let us go back to this particular example.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Now I am going back to 200 liters.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And somebody has opened 300 liters.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
The control system is seeing that, oh, the level has started falling.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
The control system measuring that is looking at the rate of fall of the level.
