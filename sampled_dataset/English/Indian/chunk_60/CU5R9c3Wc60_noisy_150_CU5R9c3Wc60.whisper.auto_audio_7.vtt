00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.720
given a particular configuration of hyper parameters, right? So we will have a surrogate

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.400
model. At the same time, we cannot estimate this for all possible combinations or all possible

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.760
configurations, right? We want to minimize the number of iterations. So we need an acquisition

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.960
function also. So this acquisition function will guide the search. Guide the search means if you

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.680
are familiar with the concept of reinforcement learning, if you are familiar with reinforcement

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.560
learning with the idea behind say multi-arm bandits and all this is quite similar to that

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:35.280
where this acquisition function will have the opportunity to explore either explore or exploit.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.000
Exploit means what it means is basically we know that these regions are doing well. If we know that

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.360
these regions are doing well, we will try to for the next iteration when it goes for an exploit option,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.920
it will try to choose data points around this region. Okay, so it will go for data points in this

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.320
in this particular zone. That would be exploit. Explore would be it will try to find out or try to test out

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.640
data points that is farther away right randomly to choose some other point somewhere in the board
