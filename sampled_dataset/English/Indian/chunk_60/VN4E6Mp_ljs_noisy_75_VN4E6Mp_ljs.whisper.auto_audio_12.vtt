Venkateson's full video on this topic which will be very elaborate with great examples.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I also request you to please see his beautiful videos on Governor Drup, reverse power and other

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
complicated conceptual topics.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
They are all available on HMT YouTube site.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Mr. Venkateson is not there with us.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
His knowledge and dedication had in fact inspired me.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I am sure his fantastic videos will continue to guide generations of marine engineers in future also.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
May his soul rest in peace.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Om Shanti.
