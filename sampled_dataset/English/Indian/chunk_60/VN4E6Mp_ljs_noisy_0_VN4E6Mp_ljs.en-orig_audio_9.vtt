here it means that the wall opening

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
is going to see how fast the deviation

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.110 align:start position:0%
is going to see how fast the deviation
is<00:09:01.519><c> happening</c><00:09:01.760><c> see</c><00:09:02.000><c> rate</c><00:09:02.240><c> of</c><00:09:02.399><c> deviation</c><00:09:02.959><c> that</c>

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
is happening see rate of deviation that

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.110 align:start position:0%
is happening see rate of deviation that
means<00:09:03.279><c> how</c><00:09:03.600><c> fast</c>

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
means how fast

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.269 align:start position:0%
means how fast
the<00:09:05.279><c> deviation</c><00:09:05.839><c> is</c><00:09:05.920><c> happening</c><00:09:06.720><c> so</c><00:09:06.959><c> it</c><00:09:07.120><c> is</c>

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
the deviation is happening so it is

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:09.110 align:start position:0%
the deviation is happening so it is

so<00:09:32.080><c> we</c><00:09:32.240><c> can</c><00:09:32.480><c> also</c>

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
so we can also

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.870 align:start position:0%
so we can also

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
think it like this you see here let us

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.269 align:start position:0%
think it like this you see here let us
go<00:09:37.040><c> back</c><00:09:37.279><c> to</c>

00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
