error then to remove the offset i have
the<00:11:02.720><c> integral</c><00:11:03.200><c> action</c>

00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
the integral action

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:05.750 align:start position:0%
the integral action
the<00:11:04.240><c> whole</c><00:11:04.480><c> idea</c><00:11:04.720><c> of</c><00:11:04.800><c> this</c><00:11:05.040><c> integral</c><00:11:05.519><c> action</c>

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of this integral action

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.710 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of this integral action
is<00:11:05.839><c> to</c><00:11:06.000><c> remove</c><00:11:06.240><c> the</c><00:11:06.399><c> offset</c>

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
is to remove the offset

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.310 align:start position:0%
is to remove the offset
and<00:11:08.959><c> to</c><00:11:09.040><c> make</c><00:11:09.200><c> sure</c><00:11:09.440><c> that</c><00:11:09.680><c> the</c><00:11:09.839><c> stability</c>

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that the stability

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.069 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that the stability
point<00:11:10.560><c> is</c><00:11:10.640><c> reached</c><00:11:10.959><c> earlier</c><00:11:11.279><c> the</c><00:11:11.839><c> level</c>

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
point is reached earlier the level

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:13.829 align:start position:0%
point is reached earlier the level
doesn't<00:11:12.320><c> fluctuate</c><00:11:12.800><c> too</c><00:11:12.959><c> much</c>

00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't fluctuate too much

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
doesn't fluctuate too much
i<00:11:14.000><c> have</c><00:11:14.240><c> the</c><00:11:14.720><c> derivative</c><00:11:15.440><c> action</c><00:11:15.760><c> also</c><00:11:16.320><c> so</c>

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
i have the derivative action also so

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.590 align:start position:0%
i have the derivative action also so
then<00:11:17.200><c> when</c><00:11:17.360><c> i</c><00:11:17.440><c> have</c><00:11:17.600><c> a</c><00:11:17.760><c> pid</c><00:11:18.399><c> controller</c>

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
then when i have a pid controller

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.910 align:start position:0%
then when i have a pid controller
this<00:11:19.839><c> wall</c><00:11:20.240><c> is</c>

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
this wall is

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.430 align:start position:0%
this wall is
opening<00:11:22.240><c> of</c><00:11:22.320><c> the</c><00:11:22.399><c> value</c><00:11:22.720><c> the</c><00:11:22.800><c> resultant</c><00:11:23.279><c> of</c>

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
opening of the value the resultant of

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.269 align:start position:0%
opening of the value the resultant of
all<00:11:23.680><c> these</c><00:11:23.839><c> three</c><00:11:24.160><c> actions</c>

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
all these three actions

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:27.269 align:start position:0%
all these three actions
put<00:11:25.519><c> together</c>

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
put together

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:28.389 align:start position:0%
put together
so<00:11:27.519><c> that</c><00:11:27.680><c> is</c><00:11:27.760><c> how</c>

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
so that is how

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:30.389 align:start position:0%
so that is how
the<00:11:28.640><c> controls</c><00:11:29.200><c> are</c><00:11:29.279><c> happening</c><00:11:29.680><c> in</c><00:11:29.760><c> the</c><00:11:30.000><c> pid</c>

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
the controls are happening in the pid

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.230 align:start position:0%
the controls are happening in the pid
