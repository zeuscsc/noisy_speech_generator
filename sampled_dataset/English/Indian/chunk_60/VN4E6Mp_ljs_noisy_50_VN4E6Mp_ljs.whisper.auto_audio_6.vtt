00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And when the level is here, the valve is full shut.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So what have I done here?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I have ensured that for a small change in the deviation, I am creating a bigger change in the opening of the valve or shutting of the valve.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So this adjustment is in simple terms called the proportional band.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The narrower the proportional band, I can reduce the maximum deviation.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Now this is what people roughly refer to as proportional band.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It is in fact, it in fact tells you about the sensitivity of the corrective action with respect to the error.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:53.000
This proportional band is also sometimes mathematically they define it as it is the opposite of gain.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But we will not speak about it unnecessarily here to keep things simple.
