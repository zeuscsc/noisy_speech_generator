00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Then to remove the offset, I have the integral action.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
The whole idea of this integral action is to remove the offset.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And to make sure that the stability point is reached earlier, the level doesn't fluctuate

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
too much, I have the derivative action also.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So then when I have a PID controller, this valve is, opening of the valve is the resultant

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
of all these three actions put together.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
So that is how the controls are happening in a PID controller.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
The processing of these controls can be pneumatic, electronic, digital.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And generally they can be used for anything like controlling the level, controlling the

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
pressure, controlling the temperature, controlling the speed.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So the topic is much more than what we are described here.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
I recommend you to please go to the link provided in the description section to see our dear VR

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Venkateson's full video on this topic which will be very elaborate with great examples.
