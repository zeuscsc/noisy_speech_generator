00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So going back to the level of water in the tank.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So we know that the valve was opening faster when the error happened and the error got stabilized here.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Now if I don't want the error to be there at all, we have another trick in our cupboard.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And that is called the integral action.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Now what is integral action?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It may be a little bit jargonish, but we say that rate of corrective action is proportional to the deviation.
