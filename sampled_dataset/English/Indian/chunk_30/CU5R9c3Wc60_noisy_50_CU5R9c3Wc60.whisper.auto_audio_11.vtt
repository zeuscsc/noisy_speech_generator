00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.080
quite fast. So this is the fundamental idea behind Bayesian optimization. But how does this work?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.600
So what we are concerned is about finding the probability of getting a specific model score,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.960
getting a specific model score. This could be model score. This could be a cost function,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.640
cost function or sorry, the loss function, loss function like error, some type of an error or

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.520
it could be accuracy, right? Accuracy means we want to maximize it. Loss function means we want to

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.600
minimize it. Error means we want to minimize it, right? So what is the probability of getting a particular

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.400
model score given a particular configuration of the hyper parameters? So this is ultimately what we want
