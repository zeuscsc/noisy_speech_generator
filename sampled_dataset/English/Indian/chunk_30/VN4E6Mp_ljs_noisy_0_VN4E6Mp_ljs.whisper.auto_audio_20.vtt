The control system measuring that is looking at the rate of fall of the level.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And it is now going to predict, oh, at this rate the level is falling so fast.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
That means I need to open much more.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So the deviation is actually triggering the proportional action and already opening the

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
valve.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And the differential action is predicting that at how fast the level is falling.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So I will open that much more.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So what will happen?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
The stability will be arrived much earlier here.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
The level will settle here rather than here if derivative action was not there.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Right?
