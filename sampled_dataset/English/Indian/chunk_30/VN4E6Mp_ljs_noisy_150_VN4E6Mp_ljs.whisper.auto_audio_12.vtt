00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And when the level is here, the valve is full shut.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So what have I done here?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I have ensured that for a small change in the deviation, I am creating a bigger change in the opening of the valve or shutting of the valve.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So this adjustment is in simple terms called the proportional band.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The narrower the proportional band, I can reduce the maximum deviation.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Now this is what people roughly refer to as proportional band.
