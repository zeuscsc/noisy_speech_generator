00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We want the water level to be maintained here, we call this at the set point.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Presently it is in a steady state balanced with water flowing in, supply water flowing in at 200 liters per minute and water being consumed from the tank at 200 liters per minute.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I have a supply wall here, which is presently 50% open, I can keep it 100% open or 100% shut.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And this wall can be controlled incrementally or say proportionately between this full open and full shut position.
