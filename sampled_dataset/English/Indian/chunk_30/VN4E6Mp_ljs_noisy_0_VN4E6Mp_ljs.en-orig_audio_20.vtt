00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.790 align:start position:0%
control system measuring that is looking
the<00:09:58.399><c> rate</c><00:09:58.720><c> of</c><00:09:58.880><c> fall</c><00:09:59.279><c> of</c><00:09:59.440><c> the</c>

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
the rate of fall of the

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.990 align:start position:0%
the rate of fall of the
level

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
level

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.750 align:start position:0%
level
and<00:10:02.240><c> it</c><00:10:02.480><c> is</c><00:10:02.640><c> now</c><00:10:02.880><c> going</c><00:10:03.040><c> to</c><00:10:03.120><c> predict</c><00:10:03.440><c> oh</c><00:10:03.680><c> at</c>

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
and it is now going to predict oh at

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.509 align:start position:0%
and it is now going to predict oh at
this<00:10:04.000><c> rate</c><00:10:04.240><c> the</c><00:10:04.320><c> level</c><00:10:04.560><c> is</c><00:10:04.640><c> falling</c><00:10:04.959><c> so</c><00:10:05.200><c> fast</c>

00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
this rate the level is falling so fast

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:07.670 align:start position:0%
this rate the level is falling so fast
that<00:10:05.680><c> means</c><00:10:05.920><c> i</c><00:10:06.000><c> need</c><00:10:06.160><c> to</c><00:10:06.320><c> open</c><00:10:06.560><c> much</c><00:10:06.880><c> more</c>

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
that means i need to open much more

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.910 align:start position:0%
that means i need to open much more
so<00:10:07.920><c> the</c><00:10:08.079><c> deviation</c><00:10:08.720><c> is</c><00:10:08.880><c> actually</c><00:10:09.440><c> triggering</c>

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
so the deviation is actually triggering

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.430 align:start position:0%
so the deviation is actually triggering
the<00:10:10.079><c> proportional</c><00:10:10.640><c> action</c><00:10:10.880><c> and</c><00:10:11.040><c> already</c>

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
the proportional action and already

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.030 align:start position:0%
the proportional action and already
opening<00:10:11.760><c> the</c><00:10:11.920><c> wall</c>

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
opening the wall

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.750 align:start position:0%
opening the wall
and<00:10:13.279><c> the</c><00:10:13.680><c> differential</c><00:10:14.320><c> action</c><00:10:14.720><c> is</c>

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
and the differential action is

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.990 align:start position:0%
and the differential action is
predicting<00:10:16.240><c> that</c><00:10:16.480><c> at</c><00:10:16.959><c> how</c><00:10:17.279><c> fast</c><00:10:17.600><c> the</c><00:10:17.680><c> level</c><00:10:17.920><c> is</c>

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
predicting that at how fast the level is

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.310 align:start position:0%
predicting that at how fast the level is
falling<00:10:18.320><c> so</c><00:10:18.480><c> i'll</c><00:10:18.640><c> open</c><00:10:18.880><c> that</c><00:10:19.120><c> much</c><00:10:19.360><c> more</c>

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
falling so i'll open that much more

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.310 align:start position:0%
falling so i'll open that much more
so<00:10:20.480><c> what</c><00:10:20.640><c> will</c><00:10:20.800><c> happen</c><00:10:21.120><c> the</c><00:10:21.279><c> stability</c><00:10:22.079><c> will</c>

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
so what will happen the stability will

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.870 align:start position:0%
so what will happen the stability will
be<00:10:22.560><c> arrived</c><00:10:23.040><c> much</c><00:10:23.360><c> earlier</c><00:10:23.760><c> here</c><00:10:24.399><c> the</c><00:10:24.560><c> level</c>

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
be arrived much earlier here the level

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.190 align:start position:0%
be arrived much earlier here the level
will<00:10:25.040><c> settle</c><00:10:25.360><c> here</c><00:10:26.079><c> rather</c><00:10:26.399><c> than</c><00:10:26.560><c> here</c><00:10:26.800><c> if</c><00:10:27.040><c> the</c>

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
will settle here rather than here if the

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.110 align:start position:0%
will settle here rather than here if the
derivative<00:10:27.680><c> action</c><00:10:27.839><c> was</c><00:10:28.079><c> not</c><00:10:28.320><c> there</c>

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
derivative action was not there

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.230 align:start position:0%
derivative action was not there
right
