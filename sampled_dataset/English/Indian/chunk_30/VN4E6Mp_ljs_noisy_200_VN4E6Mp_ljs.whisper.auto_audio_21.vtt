00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
The level will settle here because it was predictive in nature.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And the integral action will put it back to the set point because it will remove the

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
offset.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Let us summarize the whole thing.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Depending on the error and the relationship between the error and the opening of this

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
valve, there are three types of action.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
One is the one which is proportional action.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So the valve is going to be operated by the P proportional action which is going to depend

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
on the error.
