Because I think the approach of Chinese innovators, first start from trying to address a problem, solve a problem.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And if we look at much of the developing world, it really isn't about access to advanced technologies that matters.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
But it's really about adoptability.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Very interesting.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Since you mentioned about the US-China rivalry, maybe we can end with that question.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
So do you think it's still possible for China and US to reach a deal? What would the deal look like?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:37.000
You know, it's very interesting that Mr. Trump or President Trump's view of China seems to be evolving over time.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
We don't really know, but I think that in terms of competition, it's always going to be there.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:51.000
US and Japan competition was quite ferocious in major tech sectors, but it really pushed US to improve.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
US to spend a lot more on its innovation system and reform its innovation system.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And in turn, so did Japan, and as a result, we all have cheaper, better products.
