And this is the kind of social services that will not only stimulate things like fertility, but also free up some resources for demand.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So I think lots of lessons to be learned from those countries.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000
What type of a structural reform would be necessary in order to push China to make those changes?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Like in the past, probably if one city government managed to invite more manufacturers to set shopping in their place,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
then they actually get rewarded by tax and many other things. So what needs to be changed?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.000
It is true that unless a few fundamental core challenges in the Chinese economy is not resolved over time,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
you're going to continue with that imbalance, whether China's economic week or economically strong.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And what is the relationship between local and central government?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Local governments still have the burden of taking up the majority of the expenditure and the social and the local economy,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
but it obviously relied in the past a lot on land sales and real estate as a source of revenue.
