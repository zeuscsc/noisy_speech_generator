But cyclically, in the last few years, a lot of was precautionary saving.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000
It was due to low wages or low growth in real wages, and also expectations about the future.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I think people's expectations about jobs and the future is not as rosy as it was before, so they want to save.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And, of course, the household balance sheet was also weakened by the real estate downturn.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Unfortunately, it's the rural population, hundreds of millions of people still have a lack of access to social insurance and social infrastructure.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Now, if we dig a little bit deeper, it also stems from the tax structure, which I think there has to be performed as well,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000
very narrow tax base, income tax base, but also the government is heavily reliant on indirect taxation like VAT.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So direct taxation, which helps with redistribution, is quite weak.
