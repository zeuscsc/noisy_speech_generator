Maybe this is very politically incorrect to mention this, but it's kind of like the immigration issue, right?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000
When you have lots of people coming into their jurisdiction, what do they do about local employment and jobs and stability and so forth?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So I think there are some challenges, but one example is in Tianjin, they want to obviously stabilize the real estate sector.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So one policy they proposed was, well, anyone who buys a property here can have access to local schools.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
That will stimulate a lot of demand.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So you see that? There's still a lot of controls in place in China, even in the first-year cities and property and the social infrastructure.
