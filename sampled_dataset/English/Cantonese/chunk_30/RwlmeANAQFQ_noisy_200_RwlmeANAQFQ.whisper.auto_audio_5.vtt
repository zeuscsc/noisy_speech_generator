The fact that China absolutely dominates so much in manufacturing is going to be a problem for other developing countries.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I think there will be a backlash until they structure that, they redress that imbalance.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And how to do that?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Well, I mean, the easiest way is still coming back to domestic demand.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But maybe they need to have some voluntary restraints on exports as well.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That's a very interesting point you are mentioning.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Because we also noticed that China seems to be trying to address the issue with both the demand side and supply side.
