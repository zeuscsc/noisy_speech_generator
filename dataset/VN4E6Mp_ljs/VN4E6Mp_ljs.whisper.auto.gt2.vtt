00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Today being teacher's day,let us pay a small tribute to Mr.V.R.Venkatesan,who was undoubtedly one of the best teachers for marine engineers.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
He was considered a guru of control engineering amongst marine engineers.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
It may be impossible for most of us to understand this topic the way he had understood.

00:27.000 --> 00:40.000
I might have never ever dared to make a video on this topic,but as an afterthought I felt the best tribute I can pay to V.R.V.is to make a small video on a topic he had really loved and mastered.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
I had always found this topic very challenging and still have lots of gaps in my understanding.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
The clarity of thought V.R.V.had will always be elusive to most of us.

00:50.000 --> 01:01.000
I strongly hope that I will be able to do some justice to this topic and generate enough interest to direct you to his elaborate video on this topic in HMT YouTube channel.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
The link for his full length video will be available in the description.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
With a small request to the departed soul to guide us further on the pursuit to understand marine engineering,let us move on to the video.

01:12.000 --> 01:23.000
In this video we will try and understand the basics of three types of control action proportional,integral and derivative.

01:23.000 --> 01:32.000
Most of the materials available in the internet or in the books look at it in a very mathematical way like this.

01:32.000 --> 01:41.000
This is proportional to KPE in some brackets,some T,which is terrifying to most of us marine engineers except for a gifted few.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
If somebody wants elaboration on mathematics,please do request in comment section we can handle it separately.

01:47.000 --> 01:56.000
But let us now try to understand it in a very rudimentary way without any mathematics by taking the example of maintaining the level of water in the tank.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
We want the water level to be maintained here,we call this at the set point.

02:02.000 --> 02:17.000
Presently it is in a steady state balanced with water flowing in,supply water flowing in at 200 liters per minute and water being consumed from the tank at 200 liters per minute.

02:17.000 --> 02:28.000
I have a supply wall here,which is presently 50% open,I can keep it 100% open or 100% shut.

02:28.000 --> 02:37.000
And this wall can be controlled incrementally or say proportionately between this full open and full shut position.

02:37.000 --> 02:47.000
Now the water level in the tank is supposed to be maintained here and if by chance the water level falls here,what I have is a error.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
We call it as a deviation or offset or error.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
We also sometimes use the jargon's desired value of the control variable.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
So these are all just jargon's but let us keep it simple,we want the water level to be here.

03:01.000 --> 03:12.000
Now as I already told you 200 liters of water per minute is consumed from the tank and same 200 liters per minute of water is filling the tank.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
So the level obviously is going to maintain here.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Now suddenly the consumer is now started consuming more.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
So he starts consuming 300 liters of water from the tank per minute.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
So it is obvious that the level of water in the tank will reduce.

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
Now it is obvious that if I want the level of water to be here,I need to open this wall.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
Now the question we are going to ask here is,how much will this wall open,supply wall?

03:44.000 --> 04:02.000
Now suppose I make a relationship between this error or the deviation and the opening of the wall in such a way that I establish a proportional relationship between the error and the opening of the wall.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
I call this as proportional action.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
The opening of the wall depends on how much is the error.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
That is the proportionality I am talking about.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
This opening of the wall I call it as corrective action.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
Now when I have a proportionality established,you can observe that it will happen only after the error has happened.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
That means this wall will commence opening or commence correcting only after the error has happened.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
The supply wall opens more and more as the deviation becomes more and more.

04:36.000 --> 04:46.000
As the supply wall opens more and more,there will come a point where the supply is equal to 300 liters per minute.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
The same as the consumption.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Now since the supply is equal to consumption,we call this as the steady state condition.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
Now the level will remain steady here and it will not go down any further.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
But what we have here left is the error or offset or deviation.

05:05.000 --> 05:15.000
Now suppose I had linked the proportional action in such a way that when the error is so much,the valve will be full open.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
And when the level is very high here,the valve will be full shut.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
We know that the water level has to be between these two points.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
It is not possible for the water level to cross these two limiting points.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
It has to be somewhere in between these two points.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Now you can see that this is quite a change in level possibility.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
If I don't want the water level to fluctuate so much between these two points and it should be fluctuating only between these two points.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
What do I need to do?

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
I need to ensure that when the level is here,my valve is full open.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
And when the level is here,the valve is full shut.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
So what have I done here?

06:06.000 --> 06:17.000
I have ensured that for a small change in the deviation,I am creating a bigger change in the opening of the valve or shutting of the valve.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
So this adjustment is in simple terms called the proportional band.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
The narrower the proportional band,I can reduce the maximum deviation.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
Now this is what people roughly refer to as proportional band.

06:33.000 --> 06:43.000
It is in fact,it in fact tells you about the sensitivity of the corrective action with respect to the error.

06:43.000 --> 06:53.000
This proportional band is also sometimes mathematically they define it as it is the opposite of gain.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
But we will not speak about it unnecessarily here to keep things simple.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
So going back to the level of water in the tank.

07:03.000 --> 07:13.000
So we know that the valve was opening faster when the error happened and the error got stabilized here.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Now if I don't want the error to be there at all,we have another trick in our cupboard.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
And that is called the integral action.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Now what is integral action?

07:23.000 --> 07:30.000
It may be a little bit jargonish,but we say that rate of corrective action is proportional to the deviation.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
In other terms,what does it mean?

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
If I have integral action,the integral action,see here let us take it step by step.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
Because of the proportional action,the valve started opening and here I got a steady state.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
But I got a error offset.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Now I want to eliminate the offset.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
How can I eliminate the offset?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
By making sure that the valve is opening more.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
This is exactly what the integral action is going to do.

07:54.000 --> 08:01.000
Now we have defined it mathematically as rate of corrective action is proportional to the deviation.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
Now when we say rate,obviously it means that the valve is opening.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
If the valve is not moving,then obviously there is no rate of opening.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Okay.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
That we can also say that the valve will stop opening more when the deviation is not there.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
So what do we conclude?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
We conclude that the integral action actually removes the deviation.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
So the valve will continue to open because the error is there.

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
And if the valve continues to open more than what was required,that 300 liters per minute,

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
the level will start rising up and it will remove the deviation.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
You see,this is the job of the integral action.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
Let us now look at the third option,which is called the derivative action.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
Now let us see how does it define.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
Mathematically it says that corrective action is proportional to the rate of deviation.

08:54.000 --> 09:02.000
Here it means that the valve opening is going to see how fast the deviation is happening.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
See rate of deviation.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
That means how fast the deviation is happening.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
So it is predictive in nature.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
On the basis of this prediction,this valve will continue to open more than what the P action

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
would have done.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
It is anticipating a big drop in level.

09:19.000 --> 09:29.000
The outcome of this derivative action is that the stability point with or without offset

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
is achieved quickly.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
So we can also think it like this.

09:35.000 --> 09:44.000
You see here,let us go back to this particular example.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Now I am going back to 200 liters.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
And somebody has opened 300 liters.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
The control system is seeing that,oh,the level has started falling.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
The control system measuring that is looking at the rate of fall of the level.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
And it is now going to predict,oh,at this rate the level is falling so fast.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
That means I need to open much more.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
So the deviation is actually triggering the proportional action and already opening the

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
valve.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
And the differential action is predicting that at how fast the level is falling.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
So I will open that much more.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
So what will happen?

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
The stability will be arrived much earlier here.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
The level will settle here rather than here if derivative action was not there.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Right?

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
The level will settle here because it was predictive in nature.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
And the integral action will put it back to the set point because it will remove the

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
offset.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Let us summarize the whole thing.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
Depending on the error and the relationship between the error and the opening of this

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
valve,there are three types of action.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
One is the one which is proportional action.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
So the valve is going to be operated by the P proportional action which is going to depend

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
on the error.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Then to remove the offset,I have the integral action.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
The whole idea of this integral action is to remove the offset.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
And to make sure that the stability point is reached earlier,the level doesn't fluctuate

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
too much,I have the derivative action also.

11:16.000 --> 11:23.000
So then when I have a PID controller,this valve is,opening of the valve is the resultant

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
of all these three actions put together.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
So that is how the controls are happening in a PID controller.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
The processing of these controls can be pneumatic,electronic,digital.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
And generally they can be used for anything like controlling the level,controlling the

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
pressure,controlling the temperature,controlling the speed.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
So the topic is much more than what we are described here.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
I recommend you to please go to the link provided in the description section to see our dear VR

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
Venkateson's full video on this topic which will be very elaborate with great examples.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
I also request you to please see his beautiful videos on Governor Drup,reverse power and other

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
complicated conceptual topics.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
They are all available on HMT YouTube site.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Mr.Venkateson is not there with us.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
His knowledge and dedication had in fact inspired me.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
I am sure his fantastic videos will continue to guide generations of marine engineers in future also.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
May his soul rest in peace.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Om Shanti.
