Hey there Spy there! This is your boy Mikey Bustos.

00:04.080 --> 00:08.240
This video is an in-depth tutorial of the Filipino accent.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.360
The first thing to know is there are no F sounds.

00:11.360 --> 00:15.840
Follow, Flip, Fact, Filipino, Philippines, Family, Snowflake.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.200
No B sounds.

00:17.200 --> 00:22.320
Victory, Van, Veno, Living La vida Loca, Golden Retriever.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.480
Blog and vlog sound the same.

00:24.480 --> 00:28.240
The lack of B probably comes from the Spanish influence

00:28.240 --> 00:32.240
when the Spaniards invaded Philippines in the 1500s.

00:32.240 --> 00:37.520
That is why many of us Philippine have Spanish last names like Bustos.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.000
My full name is Michael John Yadan Tumanguil Pestano Bustos.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.760
Try saying that 5 times.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.400
Also worth noting, there's no TH.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.080
It's either D sound like that, this, there, them, breathe,

00:50.080 --> 00:53.920
or T sound like thick, teeth, beneath, thistle, breath.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.520
Also, another thing to note is that the Filipino language

00:57.520 --> 01:00.560
lacks he  she, she distinct pronouns.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.800
It's only one in Pilipino, SIA.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.040
That is why many Pilipinos sometimes get he and she mixed up.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.520
Little bit confused.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.880
I like Ricky Martin.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.720
Her music is very good.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.280
Also, because Philippines is a third world,

01:15.280 --> 01:18.880
social class even determines the way you speak English.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.360
The socialites say words like promise,

01:21.360 --> 01:22.320
forever.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.400
Correct, true, kadiri to death.

01:24.400 --> 01:30.000
When I go to Philippines, I love watching TV and all the funny advertisements.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.120
Kuya, germs!

01:31.120 --> 01:31.840
Hindi ah!

01:31.840 --> 01:33.200
nako, dandruff!

01:33.200 --> 01:36.400
Use head and shoulders, kaya head and scalp healthy.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.000
70 pesos lang.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.360
People ask me why I am able to speak like this.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.640
And I tell them, even though I was born in Canada,

01:44.640 --> 01:47.680
I used to speak like this when I was very small.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.760
I learned English from my parents.

01:49.760 --> 01:54.320
Pero, but, in grade 4, I learned to speak with a proper accent

01:54.320 --> 01:57.360
so that I could fit in and the kids wouldn't make fun of me.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.680
But, I never lost it.

01:59.680 --> 02:05.200
Anyway, there are 171 native languages in Philippines.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.720
Isn't that incredible?

02:06.720 --> 02:09.680
171 different dialect?

02:09.680 --> 02:13.120
Okay, anyway, I am very proud to be Filipino,

02:13.120 --> 02:14.960
also known as Pinoy,

02:14.960 --> 02:17.360
because we are a very loving people.

02:17.360 --> 02:17.920
Yeehee!

02:17.920 --> 02:18.880
Yeehee!

02:18.880 --> 02:22.400
So the next time you cannot make out the accent of your

02:22.400 --> 02:25.440
Filipino neighbor, cause you know we're everywhere,

02:25.440 --> 02:27.680
just refer to this video tutorial.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.240
Mabuhay! See you later, heavy weighter!

02:30.240 --> 02:31.760
And Pacquiao FOR LIFE!

02:36.640 --> 02:38.880
Vlog and vlog sound the same.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.480
70 pesos lang.
