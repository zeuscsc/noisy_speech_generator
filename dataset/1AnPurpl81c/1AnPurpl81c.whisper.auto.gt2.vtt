00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
In the United Kingdom, there's British English, and in the United States, there's American English.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
In Singapore, we have Singaporean English, or more commonly known as Singlish.

00:12.000 --> 00:20.000
You can usually hear Singlish used for informal conversations and might be confused by its different standards of English.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
So how exactly is Singlish different from British and American English?

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
And what do all the lah, leh and lor represent?

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
Singlish started when Singapore became an independent nation and introduced English into their country.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
As a former colony of britain, Singapore used British English as their official language for their administrations.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
If you were a Singaporean at that time, it would be the first time you would have proper classes and learn about the ABCs.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
But back then, there was only a minority group of elites who were proficient in English.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
The rest of Singapore's population consisted of the Chinese, Malays, and Indians, who were former migrants and only spoke their own native languages.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
So when these non-English speakers were introduced to Standard English, they influenced English with their own native languages, molding it into what we know today as Singlish.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Like any other language, Singlish has its own sets of rules and vocabulary.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
You can use Singlish to get your points across faster with less words.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
For example, in Standard English you would say,

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
Seems like it is going to rain today. I think it would be best for you to bring an umbrella out.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Which comes to a total of 21 words.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Whereas, when you use Singlish, you could say,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Like gonna rain liao, bring an umbrella la.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
That's only 7 words.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
Another interesting example is the Singlish word la that originates from its Chinese counterpart.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Lah is very versatile and can be used for many different contexts.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
For example, you can say,

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Sorry lah, to make your apology sound less formal.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
If you want to blame someone, you could say,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
All your fault lah, where the lah emphasizes your anger.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
You can also use lah to reassure someone by saying,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Don't worry, can fix one lah.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
As shown, Singlish has a different standard of English,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
making it difficult for the rest of the world to understand.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
This brought the attention of the government,

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
as Singlish had decreased the country's overall English standards.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
They were concerned Singlish would hinder Singapore's economic development.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
So the government launched the Speak Good English movement

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
to try and improve English standards and eliminate Singlish.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
The campaign, however, was not well received by some Singaporeans.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
As Singlish helped them to maintain solidarity and friendships among themselves,

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
supporters felt that he has become a national identity and should not be abolished.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Today, though the use of Singlish is still debatable,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
we see the government and the world starting to embrace the language.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Singlish was celebrated in Singapore's 50th birthday

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
and was also added into the Oxford English Dictionary.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
All in all, Singlish defines Singaporeans and connects them with one another.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
I'm sure we can all agree that the language will definitely remain in Singapore for a very long time.
