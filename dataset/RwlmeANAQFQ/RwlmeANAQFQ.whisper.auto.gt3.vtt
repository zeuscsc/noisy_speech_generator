00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Welcome to Perspectives from HSBC,thanks for joining us and now onto today's show.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Hello everyone,thanks for joining HSBC podcast series of perspectives.

00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
Today's episode is being recorded behind the scene at the HSBC Global Investment Summit happening in Hong Kong.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
My name is Jing Nu,HSBC Chief China Economist.

00:33.000 --> 00:43.000
I'm very pleased to be joined by Ke Yu Jing,professor of economics at Harvard University and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
So today we're going to talk about China's economic development and its new playbook.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Hi Ke Yu.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Good to be with you Jing.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
We have a lot to talk about.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Nowadays we see a lot of trading partners in addition to US.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Start to complain about China is getting too competitive in it export.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
And some people are saying that China is exporting deflation.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
Apparently,especially with the US China trade tension,some other economies start to worry about.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
They might see more inflow of Chinese goods that could,to some extent,

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
put some pressure on their domestic manufacturing.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
So what's your review on this?

01:23.000 --> 01:35.000
I do believe that there is a structural issue at heart that needs to be solved over time for the benefit of China for the rest of the world.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
And indeed to maintain China's position as a global player in the world,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
that the model is steered towards the scaling up supply.

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
The whole,the local governments are not incentivized to spend as much on social services as they are nurturing champions.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
Whether it's BYD or Neo or deepseek,although deepseek is not actually backed by local governments.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
But the idea of a plan,the idea is to nurture these kind of companies.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
But they really should be spending more on social services to give the boost in demand.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
And also,Chinese companies are really competitive.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And it has very little to do with subsidies.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
If you look at majority of manufacturing,90% of manufacturing companies,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
there is no over investment.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Actually,it is responding to market forces.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
The 10% is some of the new sectors.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
But in general,that's going to cause tension.

02:25.000 --> 02:34.000
The fact that China absolutely dominates so much in manufacturing is going to be a problem for other developing countries.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
And I think there will be a backlash until they structure that,they redress that imbalance.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And how to do that?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Well,I mean,the easiest way is still coming back to domestic demand.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
But maybe they need to have some voluntary restraints on exports as well.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
That's a very interesting point you are mentioning.

02:52.000 --> 03:01.000
Because we also noticed that China seems to be trying to address the issue with both the demand side and supply side.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
On the demand side,its pivot towards stimulating consumption might be one way.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
Also start to talk about sector-specific measures in order to cut the capacity.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
And as you said,it may be restrict the export.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Does the outbound of the Iraq investment also play a role?

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
I think outbound direct investment is very much encouraged by the rest of the world,

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
well,with the exception of countries that don't welcome Chinese money,which is,I think,is not not smart.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
But,you know,that's the fact.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
If you look at around the developing world,actually,in the world today,there's a massive deficit in investment.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Agri-investment in the world is down,especially to developing countries.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
And some countries needs to fill that gap.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
I think China is very just doing so by not only investing,but maybe bringing some of its technology,

03:53.000 --> 04:02.000
but it really need to obviously help the local economy build its own economy on its own feet.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
And so,I think that should continue.That's a very different set of issues from exporting goods

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
where developing countries could also manufacture things as well.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah,this kind of resemble what Japan did in the last century.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Japan ramped up the outbounded direct investment after a plaza called,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
and then as an alternative to the export.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Do you think China will kind of looking to that kind of solution?

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
I don't see where it could be a substitute for exports

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
because you know investment abroad is obviously buying assets globally,

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
which is good for diversification of Chinese wealth,but it has a very different implication

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
from Chinese suppliers and Chinese companies being able to sell to the rest of the world.

04:53.000 --> 05:00.000
But one thing that we do need to keep in mind is that China is actually looking more and more like a big and rich country.

05:00.000 --> 05:10.000
So if you look at its export share of GDP,it's actually falling over time and converging to the US and Europe,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
which means that it's absorbing more of its own goods.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
And I think that's just a trend that it will continue.

05:17.000 --> 05:24.000
I think they just need to think about whether I still come back to this model issue,

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
because just 80 cities in China do 80 cities really all need to do EVs.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
Do they all need to do solar panels because it's a policy?

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
So there is too much competition because there's a lot of resources developing on one thing.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
So rather than doing the same thing,they should find how to do complementary things as well.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
So there are lots of things in the economy that can still be adjusted to address this problem.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
There seem to be a lot of focus on stimulating domestic demand in particular on consumption side.

05:58.000 --> 06:07.000
And actually just several days after the National People's Congress,China rose out a very comprehensive plan on stimulating the consumption.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
So can you discuss a little bit about that?

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
Well,first of all,I think that China's model,or let me be precise,political economy model,

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
is really brilliant at scaling up supply,and quite weak at raising personal consumption,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
and therefore demand.

06:25.000 --> 06:34.000
And that has caused a lot of not only domestic issues,but raise some international controversies as well.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Consumption is the big focus now.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
The government is steadfast,focused on raising consumption.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
That was very different from,let's say,10,20 years ago,where the focus was much more on supply on the firms.

06:45.000 --> 06:53.000
The whole economy was geared to subsidize supply,basically,and very weak focus on demand.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
Now,there's a cyclical and structural component to raising consumption that I think deserves differentiation.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
But cyclically,in the last few years,a lot of was precautionary saving.

07:05.000 --> 07:14.000
It was due to low wages or low growth in real wages,and also expectations about the future.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
I think people's expectations about jobs and the future is not as rosy as it was before,so they want to save.

07:21.000 --> 07:29.000
And,of course,the household balance sheet was also weakened by the real estate downturn.

07:29.000 --> 07:39.000
More fundamentally,it's the rural population,hundreds of millions of people still have a lack of access to social insurance and social infrastructure.

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
Now,if we dig a little bit deeper,it also stems from the tax structure,which I think there has to be performed as well,

07:46.000 --> 07:55.000
very narrow tax base,income tax base,but also the government is heavily reliant on indirect taxation like VAT.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
So direct taxation,which helps with redistribution,is quite weak.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
And then the secondary redistribution through social insurance is obviously also inadequate given that rule.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
Consumers have what an average of 5% of an average pension of the urban household.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
And also the 300 million migrant workers,you know,they have even with the same income as an urban worker,

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
they spend only one third of that equivalent of a consumption of urban worker.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
So this is the focus of the current government.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
So I want to follow up on that.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Actually,this sounds like a very ambitious plan.

08:32.000 --> 08:41.000
When we look at that,there's a mention of in the future,the migrant workers and their families can tap into the basic public services,

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
basically according to their permanent residence.

08:46.000 --> 08:54.000
In the past,we have seen China trying to push forward the household registration reform,but we've limited success.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
So what makes it different this time?

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
First of all,there's a real intention that they need to stabilize the real estate problem.

09:05.000 --> 09:15.000
And there is sufficient demand if urbanization can continue and rural population can be properly integrated into the formal economy.

09:15.000 --> 09:24.000
But also,I still think that there are challenges because local governments,they operate in their own kind of autonomous sort of way,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
like any other government they care about social stability.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
Maybe this is very politically incorrect to mention this,but it's kind of like the immigration issue,right?

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
When you have lots of people coming into their jurisdiction,what do they do about local employment and jobs and stability and so forth?

09:41.000 --> 09:50.000
So I think there are some challenges,but one example is in Tianjin,they want to obviously stabilize the real estate sector.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
So one policy they proposed was,well,anyone who buys a property here can have access to local schools.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
That will stimulate a lot of demand.

09:58.000 --> 10:05.000
So you see that?There's still a lot of controls in place in China,even in the first tier cities and property and the social infrastructure.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
And if you loosen them,there will be a proper rebound of domestic demand.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah,mentioning about the school choice,just remind me of another city,the capital city of Inner Mongolia,

10:17.000 --> 10:24.000
which actually roll out these subsidies for child care,including if a family have three children,

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
then they can pretty much choose wherever their kids go to school.

10:28.000 --> 10:36.000
So it's also a big step for Chinese government to start subsidizing the child care and maybe elderly care as well.

10:36.000 --> 10:44.000
Well,I think that's the right thing to do.I think that China has to learn from other countries that have been relatively successful in raising fertility.

10:44.000 --> 10:52.000
And obviously providing child care services,obviously,gives more freedom to the working women of the household.

10:52.000 --> 11:02.000
And this is the kind of social services that will not only stimulate things like fertility,but also free up some resources for demand.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
So I think lots of lessons to be learned from those countries.

11:05.000 --> 11:13.000
What type of a structural reform would be necessary in order to push China to make those changes?

11:13.000 --> 11:22.000
Like in the past,probably if one city government managed to invite more manufacturers to set shopping in their place,

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
then they actually get rewarded by tax and many other things.So what needs to be changed?

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
It is true that unless a few fundamental core challenges in the Chinese economy is not resolved over time,

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
you're going to continue with that imbalance,whether China's economic week or economically strong.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
And what is the relationship between local and central government?

11:45.000 --> 11:54.000
Local governments still have the burden of taking up the majority of the expenditure and the social and the local economy,

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
but it obviously relied in the past a lot on land sales and real estate as a source of revenue.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
And they have to ramp up a lot of debt to undertake those kind of responsibilities.

12:05.000 --> 12:12.000
But maybe the local government,KPI,should be changed from looking at GDP growth and investment to other things.

12:12.000 --> 12:21.000
Maybe consumption,maybe jobs,you think these things through,but it has to be more balanced approach.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
I think that another fundamental reform should be the redistribution system taxation.

12:29.000 --> 12:37.000
I think still lots of people are not paying taxes and direct income taxes is not very strong as a redistributionary force.

12:37.000 --> 12:47.000
A lot of the wealthy people are not really paying very high tax rates.It's actually in the end a bit regressive given that the tax system relies a lot of us at a global issue.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
It is a global issue,but China is not going to escape from that.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
But actually Chinese taxation is more regressive than in many other advanced economies.

12:56.000 --> 13:08.000
But again,coming back to the social protection,social insurance,once people think that they have sustained rising wages and employment security,

13:08.000 --> 13:15.000
they're obviously going to be more free to spend that with some kind of consumption.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
What about housing market?Are you still worried about the housing market?

13:19.000 --> 13:27.000
The real estate downturn,I think,is the really the primary factor causing China's cyclical economic downturn in the last few years,

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
because the property sector really went beyond property,unlike in other countries,which all had their ups and downs in property,

13:34.000 --> 13:42.000
because it represented two core pillars of the economy,a shadow fiscal system and a shadow financial system.

13:42.000 --> 13:49.000
Something like 90% of local government debt is tied to real estate,and 70% of national debt is tied to real estate.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
And talking about this,coming back to this mayor economy,political economy model,there was an urbanization craze.

13:55.000 --> 14:03.000
They actually went through,they went from industrialization craze to urbanization craze because property becoming even easier source of revenue.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
And so when that came down,it brought really down to pillars of the economy.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
So stabilizing real estate is absolutely crucial.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
In a good scenario,five to seven years,stabilizing,trying to come about.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Now,you're already seeing signs to seven years,counting starting from 2022.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
So we're halfway in the good scenario.

14:24.000 --> 14:34.000
And that's coming from international data.That scenario will be 10 years,so I think if you look at the wealth effect,

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
if Chinese people's wealth really drop by a third that has major consequences on consumption as well.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
So you really need to stabilize real estate to build that foundation for a stable rebound.

14:46.000 --> 14:53.000
But also to mention that you're seeing signs of a transition already in the economic structure,

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
a bit away from the real estate into broadly categorized as high tech center.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
So the government coming back to the recent Congress really is focusing on two things.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
Consumption,so domestic demand and productivity based on innovation.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah,indeed.We have seen some green shoots in terms of housing stabilization.

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
And in terms of business confidence,I think deepseek disruption really has made a big difference.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
Well,it was interesting because I was still debating foreign policy on peak China,the concept of peak China.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
I went from peak China to a few months later,deepseek moment,a major pendulum swing.

15:35.000 --> 15:43.000
And I keep on having to remind the Western audience that this isn't what always happens when you predict China like that,

15:43.000 --> 15:49.000
going from collapse,oops,second edition collapse,oops,no,third edition,then peak China.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
Oh,and then deepseek,and suddenly everybody's interested in China again,right?

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah,nobody's talking about China is uninvestable.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Not anymore.And that was a major thing.

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
More clients are asking me about what's going on in China,what kind of the next deepseek moment will be.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
Exactly.So this is what I've been trying to argue that China's fundamentals are there.

16:09.000 --> 16:17.000
China's long-term potential is there.Just look at the people,the skills,the hard work,the scale,the market,the innovation.

16:17.000 --> 16:24.000
Yes,in a short-term confidence has been the major hindrance to the Chinese economic situation.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
But that's also very hard to rebuild,of course,but the fundamentals are there.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
It's a very different country from just the normal countries that form to the middle-income trap.

16:34.000 --> 16:43.000
Yeah,indeed.I think nobody would expect all of us on the tech companies and other type of companies are interested in increase the capex.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
Because of the deepseek,because of the potential of integrating AI into their production.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
Actually,deepseek caught the world by surprise.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
But I don't think it caught China by that much of a surprise.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
Of course,Chinese people were thrilled because,hey,look,it will happen to these export controls and tech restrictions.

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
They're able to make these major achievements.

17:08.000 --> 17:16.000
Because if we look in live in China,observe that the daily lives,innovation is happening here and there all the time.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Breakthroughs,small and large are at every level.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
So that's something to keep in mind.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
And it does permeate throughout the economy.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
The interesting thing is that I don't think this is head-on competition with the US.

17:30.000 --> 17:37.000
US does these breakthroughs,more systematic model-based.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
The Chinese applications are really,really useful.

17:40.000 --> 17:52.000
Because ultimately,the success of the technology and how much it actually impacts the economy depends on how much it's adopted,how accessible it is,and how much it permeates throughout society and everyday lives.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
And Chinese applications and Chinese technology are very much suited for that.

17:57.000 --> 18:04.000
Because I think the approach of Chinese innovators,first start from trying to address a problem,solve a problem.

18:04.000 --> 18:11.000
And if we look at much of the developing world,it really isn't about access to advanced technologies that matters.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
But it's really about adoptability.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Very interesting.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
Since you mentioned about the US-China rivalry,maybe we can end with that question.

18:20.000 --> 18:27.000
So do you think it's still possible for China and US to reach a deal?What would the deal look like?

18:27.000 --> 18:37.000
You know,it's very interesting that Mr.Trump or President Trump his view of China seems to be evolving over time.

18:37.000 --> 18:43.000
We don't really know,but I think that in terms of competition,it's always going to be there.

18:43.000 --> 18:51.000
US and Japan competition was quite ferocious in major tech sectors,but it really pushed US to improve.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
US to spend a lot more on its innovation system and reform its innovation system.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
And in turn,so did Japan,and as a result,we all have cheaper,better products.

19:00.000 --> 19:09.000
So for investors,at least from what I'm observing,if I were an investor,I think about being in both camps,if I can,to the extent possible.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Because there'll be some that will be successful in China and the US.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
And you just don't know,you don't know which one,because both have its respective advantages.

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
But it's also,on a more sanguine note,it's also less likely that they're going to converge rather than move in parallel.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
Thanks for sitting down with us and discuss all those interesting issues today.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Hope to see you again in the near future.Thanks.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
