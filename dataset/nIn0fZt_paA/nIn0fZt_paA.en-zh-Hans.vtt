00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
Why is it that some people use the same credit card

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.840
well while

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.760
others end up with huge debts?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.400
But donâ€™t you feel bad if you really paid more money for nothing

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.360
?

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.560
Normal people would think, "

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.480
I paid more for this purchase." Right,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.120


00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.280
then I won't do that.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.480
But you didn't get nothing.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.080
You gained time.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.760
Wow,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.760
it's amazing.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.160
Your idea is really interesting. I've

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.080
never seen anything like this.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.720
No matter how you use it, the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.800
birth of credit cards can be said to be a conspiracy. In

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.040
our daily lives, we

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.800
have actually fallen into the trap when we use

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.880
credit cards to make purchases. But even when faced with the traps set by credit card companies,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.960


00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.320
we have ways

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.720
to crack the merchants' tricks.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.040
I believe everyone has a card in hand.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.040
No matter how good your investment is, the

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.120
wrong use of credit cards

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.920
can destroy the wealth you have worked hard to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.720
build. In

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.280
this episode, let's talk about the price

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.360
behind the convenience of credit cards.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.960


00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.320


00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.080
How do credit card companies with endless discounts make money from us?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.480
And how can we make

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.440
money back from credit cards?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.000
Remember that the Shifu teaching series

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.840
will have a new look

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.760
and you will see more new faces of colleagues behind the scenes. We

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.040
strive to continue to present the knowledge of financial management and investment to everyone in a more down-to-earth way.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.000


00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.040


00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.280
I hope everyone will support us.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.080
YouTube's algorithm is getting harder and harder to play.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.720

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.800
remember to subscribe and press the bell to get a sneak peek.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.240
Like and share with friends, so you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.520
won't miss the opportunity to learn about financial management and investment easily.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.920
A convenient credit card

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.560
is a nightmare for many people. Four

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.000
out of ten Americans

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.840
have a lot of credit card debt,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.800
and one in ten of them will

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.600
never be able to pay it off in their lifetime. In

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.680
Hong Kong, 60% of people

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.760
have at least three credit cards. In the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.880
fourth quarter of 2023,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.040
Hong Kong people used a total of 160 billion credit cards.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.120


00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.200


00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.680
What is the price behind the freedom that credit cards seem to give us?

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.720
In fact, it turns out that many people still don't know the operating principle of

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.800
this card that has been in their wallets for decades.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.200


00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.520
So we interviewed our colleagues

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.480
to see how much they know about credit cards. They

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.200
use credit cards a lot,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.240
but do they know how credit cards make money?

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.160
Merchants charge fees.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.320
I guess they make

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.840
money from people who can't pay back their debts.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.840
In addition, they make money from merchants' cooperation fees.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.360
It seems that my colleagues don't know much about credit cards.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.720
Fortunately,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.080
to understand the operating mechanism of credit cards, it's nothing more

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.960
than one word,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.280
"trust", which

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.560
is credit in English.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.520
In the financial world, there are generally two types of people.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.440
One is the creditor, who has money to lend to others, and the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.480
other is the debtor.  If you want money, you have to ask for it. These

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.440
two groups of people go back and forth,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.680
driving the economy endlessly.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.480
But to decide whether to borrow or not and how much to borrow,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.480
it depends a lot on this thing.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.480
Credit scoring.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.320
In fact, everyone, regardless of whether they are good or bad,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.280
will be given a score based on their credit record

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.240
and a set of scoring criteria.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.240


00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.040
Banks and credit card companies

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.160
use this digital score to

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.440
assess how risky it is to lend you money.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.120
Hong Kong's credit scores are divided into ten levels,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.120
from A to J,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.800
with A being the highest. Whether you need a

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.400
mortgage to buy a house,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.400
borrow money for turnover, or do

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.760
business, you will need this score.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.480
And the fastest way to get this credit record is to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.640
apply for a credit card. In

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.640
1958, the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.880
first credit card with a revolving credit loan function,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.440
BankAmericard, was born, which

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.440
is the predecessor of Visa Card.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.160
On the surface, this card brings convenience to modern people. You

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.080
can buy now and pay later with a simple scan.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.080
But when you open the package, you will find that it

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.680
is actually a financial product full of traps.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.240
Of course, are the big credit card companies

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.600
running charity organizations?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.920
In order to win our favor, a credit card

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.920
offers welcome gifts,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.200
cash rebates, and

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.920
various discounts.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.400
How can they earn our money by spending money like this?

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.400
For credit card companies,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.680
there are two kinds of people in this world:

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.040
those who owe money at the end of the month, which is in disguise of borrowing money, and

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.400
those who pay off their credit cards in full at the end of the month.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.360
In foreign countries, there is a special term for these people:

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.480
Deadbeats.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.160
You need to make sure that you have never paid a penny of interest

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.280
to the credit card company,

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.800
and have reaped all the benefits of credit cards.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.640
However, even if these deadbeats take all the money

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.280
and never owe

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.600
money, credit card companies still have ways to make money.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.440
One is to charge a handling fee from merchants, which is

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.880
generally between 1.5% and 3%.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.560
For example, if a restaurant has a turnover of 1 million, a

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.040
2.5% handling fee is about 25,000 yuan.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.760
So every large purchase you make

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.920
is to help them make money.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.400
And if you are an exclusive customer with a black card,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.400
you can buy anything you want. You

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.840
used 1.08 billion to

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.960
buy Picasso's "Woman with a Watch",

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.360
and the 2.5% handling fee

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.960
made the credit card company earn 27 million yuan. The

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.760
second method is to use interest,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.800
targeting a group of low-income people who

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.480
only pay the minimum repayment amount and

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.280
maintain a long-term debt status. I

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.520
just mentioned this group of people  It accounts for a

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.720
considerable proportion of the entire society.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.880
Once the interest compounding model is started, the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.880
bank's income can be terrifyingly

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.880
considerable. How terrifying is it?

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.160
Let's make an assumption first.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.840
Suppose you swipe your card to buy an

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.960
Apple Vision Pro worth 27,000 yuan.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.040
From the day you consume it, you are already borrowing money from the bank.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.840
As long as you pay late

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.840
or only pay the minimum repayment every month,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.200
what are the consequences? Interest

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.040
has been accrued since the date of transaction.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.920
If it continues to compound day after day,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.560
interest on interest must also be calculated.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.920
Within a few years, the

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.040
interest you pay will be more than the

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.040
amount you actually swipe the card.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.400
Looking at this HSBC credit card counter, it

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.040
will be clear.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.280
Using 27,000 yuan to

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.760
buy an Apple Vision Pro,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.560
as long as you pay the minimum repayment, it will take 14 years to

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.360
pay off the amount. The

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.560
total interest does not include the principal. The special

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.560
discount of 56,000 yuan

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.640
is two more Apple Vision Pros.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.840
Congratulations.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.600
So the minimum repayment amount

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.120
can only take you to heaven for a short time.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.720
What is the actual price? The

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.120
interest will push you into the abyss of hell, and there is

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.720
no way back.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.480
So you must repay on time.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.520
If you don't have any outstanding balance,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.520
you are smart.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.720
In fact, the

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.800
largest source of income for credit card companies is interest, which

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.520
accounts for 56%. There are also

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.520
annual fees,

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.520
overdue fines, etc.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.200
Two-thirds of the income comes

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.520
from consumers themselves, that

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.520
is, credit card holders. The

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.240


00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.000
remaining small part of the income comes

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.320
from merchants themselves.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.280
In addition to this,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.120
credit cards also use a

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.120
method that seems to have nothing to do with money to make money, which is

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.080
psychology.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.000
Have you ever thought about

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.840
why the monthly statement is designed like this? Why in the

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.440
upper right corner, in addition to the total outstanding balance, there is

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.440
also a credit limit and minimum

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.760
repayment amount? Why is the credit limit initially granted to you

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.640
higher than your monthly salary? The

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.640
promotional website is beautifully designed,

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.640
but when it comes to the star-level

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.240
terms and conditions, it is more difficult to understand than reading classical Chinese.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.440
These are designed after countless experiments and

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.760
A/B Testing.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.760
Credit card companies like people like

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.880
us who don't pay back at

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.080


00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.680


00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.480


00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.800


00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.680


00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.280
all the time the most. Our collective financial management habits make them make a lot of money, so how can they not carefully create various discounts to encourage you to open a card and really use it to the fullest. What

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.680
percentage of people pay on time? They are

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.800
overpaid.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.960
Fortunately, we also have the habit of using credit cards.  They are

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.800
all relatively healthy.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.000
If you want to know what kind of traps they have been in and what

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.440
I think of their card swiping habits,

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.600


00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.200
remember to watch the previous episode of the Shi Fu teaching series.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.200
Some of the bits are very resonant,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.000
but some are so funny.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.600
Even I learned something.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.600
Credit cards are evil,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.600
but for many people, they

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.400
are still a great invention.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.000
Keep at least two or three in your wallet just in case,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.240
because this card still

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.520
brings us certain benefits. So

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.520
what exactly does it mean to

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.720
use credit cards well?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.560
You won't be fined by it,

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.200
but you can use up its limit. It

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.760
should be

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.200
not to let it get any money from me. What the

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.000
editor and colleagues said are all right,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.040
and they have exactly mentioned the two major advantages of using credit cards.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.320


00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.120
I think using credit cards well

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.920
can be divided into two levels.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.520
Level 1 is to use addition thinking. The

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.480
simplest and most direct way

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.320
is to take advantage of its benefits.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.920
Know how to use credit card reward programs,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.840
welcome offers, rebates, etc. It

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.840
is best to set up automatic repayments and

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.040
pay in full every month.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.840
And the premise is to actively choose a credit card that suits you,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.840
rather than waiting for the credit card to choose you. Is

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.840
n't it just applying for it randomly?

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.440
In turn, it will only increase the risk of debt.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.040
Level 2 is multiplier thinking.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.040
Use the benefits of credit to

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.840
achieve greater results.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.040
Many people immediately turn their heads and turn their heads when they hear about borrowing money.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.960
For example, the previous generation taught us that we

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.600
would rather others owe us money than

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.160
we owe others money. This is

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.760
totally wrong.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.520
Although credit cards are a lending tool,

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.560
remember that borrowing

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.560
money itself is neutral. The

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.160
key lies in what you borrow money for. What

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.440
you buy

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.800
directly determines whether the

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.000
debt is a good debt or a bad debt.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.960
Rich people are bound to have debts.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.080
They will borrow money to do things that will increase in value,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.880
buy things that will appreciate in value,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.280
or assets that will bring positive cash flow.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.080
If you pay back 1 yuan

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.480
but your income can create 2 yuan, then

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.680
achieving unlimited leverage

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.280
will only help you accumulate wealth slowly and slowly, and slowly

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.880
snowball.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.240
For example, using a good credit card repayment record to

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.880
improve your credit score, the

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.480
first thing everyone should know is that

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.600
a healthy credit record

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.920
means not using more than 30% of the credit limit

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.520
and repaying on time every month.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.760
Credit score may not be of much use to you today,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.320


00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.080
but if you

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.520
plan to do a mortgage or do business in the future and suddenly

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.400
need

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.520
money to turn around,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.120
how much you can borrow, what the interest rate is,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120


00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.720
or even whether you can borrow at all?

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.040
Credit score is absolutely the key role  There is more than one way

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.840
to prove that an institution is worthy of lending you money.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.640


00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.440
But if this credit card does

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.040
not have a credit score, it

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.240
will be difficult to help you.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.600
So the credit score system

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.440
is a double-edged sword. It depends on

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.640
how you use it.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.040
Good debt and bad debt have

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:13.680


00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.760
been discussed in detail in this episode of Borrowing Money.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.440
If you need to, go watch this episode to review.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.280
Seeing this proves that you

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.280
are very concerned about your money.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.640
But if you feel that the investment world

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.320
seems to be a maze full of fog, and you have to

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.520


00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.320
read many books

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.200
before you find ten or eight books that you think are useful, as if you are

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.160


00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.560
destined to lose a lot of money before you learn anything when you come out to make a living. If this makes

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.840
you feel dizzy,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.760
don't worry.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.040
In order to help everyone get out of this investment maze,

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.360
we have just specially prepared

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.120
a series of new and easy-to-learn and easy-to-understand learning routes.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.760
If you want to go further and further on the road of investment and financial management,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.160


00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.800
quickly go to the description column link

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.000
or scan this QR code. It's the

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.560
same sentence.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.480
Using a credit card has advantages and disadvantages. There

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.680
is a price behind the discounts and benefits.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.080
But you have Diao Chan, and

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.080
I also have Xiao Qiao and Da Qiao.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.680
We are not necessarily just used by credit cards.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.480
We can take the initiative to make good use of credit cards.  The

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.080
key is how you use it. I

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.480
don't want you to turn off the screen after watching the video

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.280
and pretend nothing happened,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.680
so I specifically want to give you three steps.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.480
Everyone go back and do your homework.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.400
First, count how many credit cards you have.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400
Do you know

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.600
how much your total credit limit is?

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.200
Second, after looking at the credit card monthly statement for the most recent month,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.800
what are your spending habits? Do you

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.200
have any outstanding balances?

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.600
I believe there will be surprises.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.800
Third, what was the reason for applying for different credit cards in the first place? Is

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.600


00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.400
this reason still valid? Do you

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.200
need to cancel the card? After

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.800
doing your homework,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.720
you are welcome to

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.920
explain and share your answers in the comment section below.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.120
Or you can write down what topic you want me to talk about.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.120
Here's a preview.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.760
Next week there will be a mysterious guest who I have watched for

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.920
four or five years. He will come

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.720
up to chat.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.720
It turns out that everyone

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.720
has their own way of using credit cards. Would

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.720
modern people not be able to survive without credit cards?

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.720


00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.520
I am very proud of the content. Remember to pay

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.920
attention. This is the end of

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.720
this episode. If you

so that more people will know about this kind of financial investment teaching.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.040
Remember that investment is not the patent of the big sharks.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.000
See you next time. Bye.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.800
Seeing this proves it. Seeing

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.400
this

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.840
!@#$%^&amp;*&amp;(

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.520
Yes,

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:46.920
the end
