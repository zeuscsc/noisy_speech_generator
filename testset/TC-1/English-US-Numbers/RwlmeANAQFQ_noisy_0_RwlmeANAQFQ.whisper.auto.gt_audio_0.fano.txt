hello everyone thanks for joining hsbc podcast series of perspectives today's episode is being recorded
behind the scene at the hsbc global investment summit happening in hong kong my name is jing neu hsbc chief china economist i'm very pleased to be joined by ko yu 
professor of economics at harvard university and hong kong university of science and technology
so today we're going to talk about china's economic development and its new playbook hi kai
we have a lot to talk about nowadays we see a lot of trading partners um you know in addition to us start to complain about china is getting too competitive in export and some people are saying that china is export ing deflation apparently especially with the us china trade tension some other economies start to worry about they might see more inflow of chinese goods that could to some extent
put some pressure on their um domestic manufacturing so what's your view on this
not my plan
yes ah
that's a very interesting point you are mentioning cause we also noticed that ah you know ah china seems to be trying to address the issue with both the demand side and supply side on the demand side um it's a pivot towards stimulating consumption might be one way and it also starts to talk about sector specific measures in order to cut the capacity and as you said maybe restrict the expo does outbound the direct investment also play a 
yeah this ah kind resemble what japan did ah in the last century japan ramp up the outbounded direct investment after plaza called and then as an alternative to the export do you think china will kind of look into that kind of 
yeah
there seem to be a lot of focus on stimulating the domestic demand in particular on consumption side and actually just several days after the national people's congress china rose out a very comprehensive plan on stimulating the consumption so can you ah discuss a little bit about that
so i want to follow upon that ah actually this sounds like a very ambitious ah plan when we look at that there's a mention of ah in the future the migrant workers and their families can tap into the basic public services ah basically according to um their permanent residents in the past we have seen china trying to push forward the household registration reform but with limited success so what makes it different this 
yeah ah mentioning about the school choice ah it just remind me of another city the capital city of ah inner mongolia which actually roll out this subsidies for childcare including if a family havs three children then they can pretty much choose wherever their kids go to school so it's also a big step for chinese government to start to subsidize the child care and maybe elderly elderly care as 
do you think um you know what type of structural reform would be necessary in order to ah push china to make those changes like in the past probably if one city government managed to invite more manufacturers to set shopping in their place than they actually get rewarded by tax and many other scenes so one needs to be changed
yeah
what about housing market are you still worried about the housing market
twenty two seven years counting starting from twenty twenty two so we are halfway
yeah indeed we have seen some green shoots in terms of housing stabilisation and in terms of business confidence i think deep sick disruption really has made a big difference
yeah nobody is ah talking about china is uninvestable
more and that was more clients were asking me about what's going on in china what kind of ah the next deep sick moment will be
yeah indeed i think nobody would expect all of us on the tech companies and other type of companies are interested in increased capex because of the deepsick because of the potential of integrate ai into their production
very interesting since you mentioned about the us china rivalry maybe we can end with that question so do you think it's still possible for china and us to reach a deal what would the deal look like
thanks for sitting down with us and discuss all those interesting issues today hope to see you again in the near future thanks
>do believe that there is a structural issue at heart that needs to be solved over time
for the benefit of china and for the rest of the world and indeed to maintain china's position as a global player in the world that the model is steered towards scaling up supply right the 
the local governments are not incentivized to spend as much on social services as they are in nurturing champions whether it's byd or neo or deep seek although deep seek is not actually backed by local governments but the idea is to nurture these kinds of companies but they really should be spending more on social services to give a boost in demand and also chinese companies are really competitive and it has very little to do with subsidies if you look at majority of manufacturing ninety percent of manufacturing companies there is no overinvestment actually it is responding to market forces the ten percent is in some of the new sectors yeah but in general um that's going to cause tension the fact that china absolutely dominates so much in manufacturing is going to be a problem for other developing countries and i think there will be a backlash until they structure that they redress that in balance and how to do that well i mean the easiest way is still coming back to domestic demand but maybe they need to have some voluntary restraints on exports as well
i think outbound direct investment is
>very much encouraged by the rest of the world well with exception of
countries that don't welcome chinese money which i think is not not smart but you know that's the fact if you look at around the developing world actually in the world today there's a massive deficit in 
angry investment in the world is down especially to developing countries and some country needs to fill that gap i think china is very just in doing so by not only investing but maybe bringing some of its technology but it really needs to 
help the local economy um
build its own economy on its own feet and so i think that should continue that's a very different set of issues from exporting goods where developing countries could also manufacture on those things that's why
i don't see where it could be a substitute for for exports because
investment abroad is obviously you know buying assets globally which is good for diversification of of chinese wealth but it has a very different implication from chinese suppliers and chinese companies being able to sell to the rest of the world but one thing that we do need to keep in mind is that china is actually looking more and more like a big and rich country so if you if you look at its export share of gdp it's actually falling over time and converging into the u s and europe which means that it's absorbing more of its own own goods and i think that's just a trend that it will continue i think they just need to think about whether i still come back to this model issue right because
does eighty cities in china do eighty cities really all need to do evs you know do they all need to do solar panels because it's a policy so there is too much competition because there's a lot of resources to vote on one thing so rather than doing the same thing they can they should find how to do complementary things as well so there are lots of things in the economy that can still be adjusted to redress this 
yeah well first of all i think that china's model or let me be precise political economy model it's really brilliant at scaling up supply and quite weak at raising personal consumption and therefore demand and that has caused a lot of not only domestic issues but raised some international controversies as as well consumption is the big focus now the government is steadfast focus on raising consumption that was very different from let's say ten twenty years ago where the focus was much more on supply on the firms you know the whole economy was geared to
subsidize supply basically and a very weak focus on demand now there's a cyclical and structural component to raising consumption that i think deserves a differentiation cyclically in the last few years a lot of it was precautionary saving it was due to low wages or low growth in real wages and also expectations about the future i think people's expectations about jobs in the future is not as rosy as it was before so they want to save and of course the household balance sheet was also weakened by the real estate downturn more fundamentally it's the rural population hundreds of millions of people still have a lack of access to social insurance and social infrastructure now if we dig a little bit deeper it also stems from the tax structure which i think has to be reformed as well very narrow tax base income tax base but also the government is heavily reliant on indirect taxation like vat so direct taxation which helps with redistribution is quite weak and then the secondary redistribution through social insurance is obviously also inadequate given that rule that consumers have what an average of five percent of an average pension of the urban household and also the three hundred million migrant workers they have even if with the same income as an urban worker they spend only one third of that equivalent of consumption of urban worker
so um this is the focus of the current government so
first of all um there is a real intention that they need to stabilize the real estate problems um and there is sufficient demand if urbanization can continue and the rural population can be properly integrated into the formal economy um but also i i still think that there are challenges because local governments they operate in their own kind of autonomous sort of 
>any other government they care about social stability
maybe this is very politically incorrect to mention this but it's kind of like the immigration issue right when you have lots of people coming into their jurisdiction what do they do about local employment and jobs and stability and so forth so i think there are some challenges 
one example is intending they want to obviously stabilize the real estate sector so one policy they proposed was what anyone who buys a property here can have access to local schools that will stimulate a lot of demand so you see that there's still a lot of controls in place in china even in the first tier cities in property and the social infrastructure and if you loosen them there will be a proper rebound of domestic demand
yeah well i think that's the right thing to do i think that china has to learn from other countries that have been relatively successful in raising fertility and obviously providing child care services 
gives more freedom to the working women of the household and this is the kind of social services that will not only stimulate things like fertility but also ah free up some resources for demand so i think lots of lessons to be learned from those 
it is true that unless a few fundamental core challenges in the chinese economy is not resolved over time you're going to continue with that imbalance whether china's economic weak or economically strong and one is the relationship between local and central government local governments still have the burden of taking up the majority of the expenditure and the social and local economy but it obviously relied in the past a lot on land sales and real estate as a source of revenue and they have to ramp up a lot of debt to undertake that those kind of responsibilities but maybe the local government kpi should be
change from looking at gdp growth and investment to other things maybe maybe consumption maybe you know jobs ah that you think to think these things through but it has to be a more balanced approach i think that another fundamental reform should be the redistribution system taxation um i think still lots of people are not paying taxes and direct income taxes is not very strong as a redistributionary force a lot of the wealthy people are not really paying very high tax rates it's actually an end a bit regressive given that the tax system relies a lot of us i can'
is a global issue but china is not going to escape from that but actually chinese taxation is more regressive than in many other advanced economies but again coming back to the the social protection social insurance um you know once people think that they have sustained rising wages and employment security they're obviously going to be more free to to spend and that will boost some kind of consumption
real estate downturn i think is the really the primary factor causing china's cyclical economic downturn in the last few years because the property sector really went beyond property unlike in other countries which all had their ups and downs in property because it represented two core pillars of the economy a shadow of fiscal system and a shadow financial system something like ninety percent of local government debt is tied to real estate and seventy percent of national debt is tied to real estate and talking about this coming back to this mayor economy political economy model there was an urbanization crate they actually went through they went from industrialization crates to urbanization crates because property becoming 
easier source of revenue and so when that came down it brought really down two pillars of the economy so stabilizing real estate is absolutely crucial
in a good scenario five to seven years stabilized trying to can move on now you're already seeing signs
in the good scenario and that's coming from international data ah ah that scenario will be ten years so i think if you look at the wealth effect ah you know if if chinese people's wealth really drop by a third that has major consequences on consumption as well so you really need to stabilized real estate to build that foundation for a stable rebound but also to mention that
you're seeing signs of a transition already in the economic structure a bit away from the real estate into broadly categorize this high tech centre so the government coming back to the recent congress really is focusing on two things consumption so domestic demand and productivity based on innovation
well it was interesting because i was still debating um foreign policy on peak china the concept of peak china and went from peak china to a few months later deep seek moment a major pendulum swing and i keep keep on having to remind the western audience that this is what always happens when you predict china like that you know going from collapse oops snow second edition collapse oops no third edition then peak china oh and then deep seek and suddenly everybody's interested in china again 
no not anymore and that was more defined to ask
exactly so this is what i've been trying to argue that china's fundamentals are there china's long term potential is there just look at the people the skills the hard work the scale the market the 
yes in the short term confidence has been the major hindrance to the chinese economic situation
but that's also very hard to rebuild of course but the fundamentals are there it's a very different country from just the normal countries that fall into the middle income track
actually
deep sea caught the world by surprise but i don't think it caught trying to buy that much of a surprise of course chinese people were very were thrilled because you know hey look what will happen to these export controls and tech restrictions kind of still able to to make these major achievements because if we look and live in china and observe that the daily lives you know innovation is happening here and there all the time right throughs small and large are at every level so that's something to keep in mind and it does permeate throughout the the economy the interesting thing is that i don't think this is head on competition with the u s right u s does these breakthroughs more systematic model ah based tha chinese applicantions are really really useful because ultimately the success of a technology and how much it actually impacts the economy depends on how much it's adopted how accessible it is and how much it permeates throughout society in our everyday lives and chinese applications and chinese technology are very much suited for that because i think the approach of chinese invaders first start from trying to address a problem solve a problem and if you look at much of the developing world it really isn't about access to advanced technologies that matters but it's really about adopt 
ah you know it's very interesting that mr trump or president trump
his view of china seems to be evolving over time we don't really know but i think that in terms of competition it's always going to be there us and japan competition was quite ferocious in major tech sectors but it really pushed us to improve us to spend a lot more on its innovation system and reform its innovation system and in turn so did japan and as a result we all have cheaper better products so for 
at least from what i'm observing if i were an investor i think about
being in both camps if i can to the extent possible because there will be some that will be successful in in china and the us and you just don't know you don't know which one because both have its respected advantages but it's also on a more sanguine node it's also less likely that they're going to converge rather than move in parallel
