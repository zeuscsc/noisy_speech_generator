Hey there Spy there!This is your boy Mikey Bustos.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.920
This video is an in-depth tutorial of the Filipino accent.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.040
The first thing to know is there are no F sounds.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.520
Follow,Flip,Fact,Filipino,Philippines,Family,Snowflake.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.880
No V sounds.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.000
Victory,Van,Veno,Living La vida Loca,Golden Retriever.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.160
Blog and vlog sound the same.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.920
The lack of B probably comes from the Spanish influence

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.920
when the Spaniards invaded Philippines in the 1500s.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.200
That is why many of us Philippine have Spanish last names like Bustos.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.680
My full name is Michael John Yadan Tumanguil Pestano Bustos.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.440
Try saying that 5 times.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.080
Also worth noting,there's no TH.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.760
It's either D sound like that,this,there,them,breathe,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.600
or T sound like thick,teeth,beneath,thistle,breath.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.200
Also,another thing to note is that the Filipino language

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.240
lacks he she,she distinct pronouns.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.480
It's only one in Pilipino,SIA.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.720
That is why many Pilipinos sometimes get he and she mixed up.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.200
Little bit confused.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.560
I like Ricky Martin.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.400
Her music is very good.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.960
Also,because Philippines is a third world,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.560
social class even determines the way you speak English.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.040
The socialites say words like promise,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.000
forever.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.080
Correct,true,kadiri to death.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.680
When I go to Philippines,I love watching TV and all the funny advertisements.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.800
Kuya,germs!

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.520
Hindi ah!

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.880
nako,dandruff!

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.080
Use head and shoulders,kaya head and scalp healthy.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.680
70 pesos lang.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.040
People ask me why I am able to speak like this.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.320
And I tell them,even though I was born in Canada,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.360
I used to speak like this when I was very small.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.440
I learned English from my parents.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.000
Pero,but,in grade 4,I learned to speak with a proper accent

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.040
so that I could fit in and the kids wouldn't make fun of me.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.360
But,I never lost it.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.880
Anyway,there are 171 native languages in Philippines.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.400
Isn't that incredible?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.360
171 different dialect?

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.800
Okay,anyway,I am very proud to be Filipino,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.640
also known as Pinoy,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.040
because we are a very loving people.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.600
Yeehee!

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.560
Yeehee!

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.080
So the next time you cannot make out the accent of your

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.120
Filipino neighbor,cause you know we're everywhere,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.360

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.920
Mabuhay!See you later,heavy weighter!

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.440

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.160
70 pesos lang.
