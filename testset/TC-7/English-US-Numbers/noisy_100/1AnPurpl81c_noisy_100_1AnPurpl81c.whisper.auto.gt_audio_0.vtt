00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In the United Kingdom,there's British English,and in the United States,there's American English.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In Singapore,we have Singaporean English,or more commonly known as Singlish.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You can usually hear Singlish used for informal conversations and might be confused by its different standards of English.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So how exactly is Singlish different from British and American English?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And what do all the lah,leh and lor represent?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Singlish started when Singapore became an independent nation and introduced English into their country.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
As a former colony of britain,Singapore used British English as their official language for their administrations.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If you were a Singaporean at that time,it would be the first time you would have proper classes and learn about the ABCs.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But back then,there was only a minority group of elites who were proficient in English.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The rest of Singapore's population consisted of the Chinese,Malays,and Indians,who were former migrants and only spoke their own native languages.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So when these non-English speakers were introduced to Standard English,they influenced English with their own native languages,molding it into what we know today as Singlish.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Like any other language,Singlish has its own sets of rules and vocabulary.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You can use Singlish to get your points across faster with less words.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
For example,in Standard English you would say,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Seems like it is going to rain today.I think it would be best for you to bring an umbrella out.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Which comes to a total of 21 words.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Whereas,when you use Singlish,you could say,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Like gonna rain liao,bring an umbrella la.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That's only 7 words.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Another interesting example is the Singlish word la that originates from its Chinese counterpart.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Lah is very versatile and can be used for many different contexts.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
For example,you can say,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Sorry lah,to make your apology sound less formal.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If you want to blame someone,you could say,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
All your fault lah,where the lah emphasizes your anger.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You can also use lah to reassure someone by saying,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Don't worry,can fix one lah.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
As shown,Singlish has a different standard of English,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
making it difficult for the rest of the world to understand.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This brought the attention of the government,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
as Singlish had decreased the country's overall English standards.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
They were concerned Singlish would hinder Singapore's economic development.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So the government launched the Speak Good English movement

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
to try and improve English standards and eliminate Singlish.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The campaign,however,was not well received by some Singaporeans.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
As Singlish helped them to maintain solidarity and friendships among themselves,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
supporters felt that he has become a national identity and should not be abolished.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Today,though the use of Singlish is still debatable,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
we see the government and the world starting to embrace the language.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Singlish was celebrated in Singapore's 50th birthday

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and was also added into the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
All in all,Singlish defines Singaporeans and connects them with one another.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm sure we can all agree that the language will definitely remain in Singapore for a very long time.
