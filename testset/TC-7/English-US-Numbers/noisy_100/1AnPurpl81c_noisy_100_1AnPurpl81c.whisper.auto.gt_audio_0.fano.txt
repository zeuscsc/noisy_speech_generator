in the united kingdom there's british english and in the united states there's american english in
village and one before the last may has been launched
>we started that's about looking in the holiday nation i'll introduce information
doesn't have to be always to reitiation as the official language of the administration's the viewers in requ were a singaporean at a time it will be the first time you would have the process and learn about the levy scenes
predicted there was only a minority deal with the needs for official language the rest of singapore's population consinstead of the chinese malays as in they will follow migrants and release from their home they give us so when these are non english speakers your interests to standard english they influence english with the whole negative languages you alligate into what we know today as singlish and many other language submissions is on a sense of news and because this situationwe can just singlish to get a place across faster with reservoirs for example in standard immigration would say seems like wet's going to rain today i think it'll be best for you to bring an umbrella which comes to a total of twenty one rooms whereas when you singlish you could say i'm going to ring out free umbrella and that's only seven words another interesting result word is a singlish word line that originates from the chinese
it's very risky that can be used for many different efforts for example ca you can say sarila to make yoan apology some less for you if you want to blame someone you can say why your cobla when a lot exercises your
you can also use a lot to reassure someone i say don't worry can fix one ah
i show singlish as a different standard of english making it difficult for the person to the attention of the government has singlish decreased the country's homework and rich standards they will consider the civilation of hindu singaporeso that a woman managed to speak with english for her to try and improve english than that's and he needs english and get paid however it's not well received by some sort of problems as singlish of the twenty eight solidareitwy otanr friendships among themselves support this family has been confidential identity and should that be avenged
today though the use of singlish is still debated which you see that the money was starting to embrace the language singlish was celebrated in singapore's fifth birthday and was also valid into english to china and singlish defines singaporeans and connects them before the board i'm sure they cannot agree that the language will definitely be read in singapore for very long time
in singapore we have zero point in english and more convenient s singlish you can usually hear singlish use for wind formulations before you might be confused but it's different standards of finish
to help this idea is to wish if it is a british and american english
>that we need to increase an obvious revitiation as
