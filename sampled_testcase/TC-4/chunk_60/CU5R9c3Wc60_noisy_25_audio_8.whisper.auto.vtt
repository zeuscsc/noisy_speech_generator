data points that is farther away right randomly to choose some other point somewhere in the board

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.160
and we'll try to explore how the model score turns out to be for a different configuration. So that's

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.840
what explore is. So to do this, there are various techniques such as the expected improvement method

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:19.440
or the upper confidence bound method you can use to use as the acquisition function. So this will

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.960
essentially guide how the model or how the algorithm is searching for the next iterate next configuration

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:32.240
of the hyper parameter. So once the next iteration or configuration is chosen, we will use again

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:40.000
the surrogate model in this step to evaluate the newly chosen configuration, right? So we will evaluate it

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.640
find the score again score or the objective function again and then use that newly found information

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:53.840
and store it back into the surrogate model again. So this process that is steps two and three,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.840
these will go on until the optimization or objective function does not improve anymore or the number of

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.200
iterations that the user has set has been achieved. So this is the whole idea behind it. If you want
