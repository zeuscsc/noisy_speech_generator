00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.360
pay off the amount. The

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.560
total interest does not include the principal. The special

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.560
discount of 56,000 yuan

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.640
is two more Apple Vision Pros.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.840
Congratulations.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.600
So the minimum repayment amount

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.120
can only take you to heaven for a short time.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.720
What is the actual price? The

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.120
interest will push you into the abyss of hell, and there is

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.720
no way back.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.480
So you must repay on time.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.520
If you don't have any outstanding balance,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.520
you are smart.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.720
In fact, the

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.800
largest source of income for credit card companies is interest, which

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.520
accounts for 56%. There are also

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.520
annual fees,

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.520
overdue fines, etc.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.200
Two-thirds of the income comes

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.520
from consumers themselves, that

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.520
is, credit card holders. The

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.240

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.000
remaining small part of the income comes

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.320
from merchants themselves.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.280
In addition to this,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.120
credit cards also use a

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.120
method that seems to have nothing to do with money to make money, which is
