If you were a Singaporean at that time, it would be the first time you would have proper classes and learn about the ABCs.

But back then, there was only a minority group of elites who were proficient in English.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The rest of Singapore's population consisted of the Chinese, Malays, and Indians, who were former migrants and only spoke their own native languages.
