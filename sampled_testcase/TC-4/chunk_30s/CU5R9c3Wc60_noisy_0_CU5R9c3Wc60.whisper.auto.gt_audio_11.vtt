00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to find out. But we want to find this. We want to find the configuration that gives the maximum or minimum

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.600
depending on the objective, giving the what is the configuration that gives the maximum model score.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.880
But at the same time, we don't have the liberty of trying out

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.680
all of these iterations, all of these configurations possible, right? The number of iterations or the

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.480
number of iterations means training here. Each training process is what we refer to as iteration.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.640
The number of iterations is something that we want to reduce. So we want to achieve this
