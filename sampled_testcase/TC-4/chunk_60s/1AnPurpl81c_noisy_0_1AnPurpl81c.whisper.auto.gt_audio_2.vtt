00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As shown, Singlish has a different standard of English,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
making it difficult for the rest of the world to understand.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This brought the attention of the government,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
as Singlish had decreased the country's overall English standards.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They were concerned Singlish would hinder Singapore's economic development.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So the government launched the Speak Good English movement

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to try and improve English standards and eliminate Singlish.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The campaign, however, was not well received by some Singaporeans.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
As Singlish helped them to maintain solidarity and friendships among themselves,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
supporters felt that he has become a national identity and should not be abolished.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Today, though the use of Singlish is still debatable,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we see the government and the world starting to embrace the language.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Singlish was celebrated in Singapore's 50th birthday

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and was also added into the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
All in all, Singlish defines Singaporeans and connects them with one another.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm sure we can all agree that the language will definitely remain in Singapore for a very long time.
