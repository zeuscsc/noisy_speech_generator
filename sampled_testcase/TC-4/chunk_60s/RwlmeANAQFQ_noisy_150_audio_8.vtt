00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
they spend only one third of that equivalent of a consumption of urban worker.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So this is the focus of the current government.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So I want to follow up on that.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Actually, this sounds like a very ambitious plan.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000
When we look at that, there's a mention of in the future, the migrant workers and their families can tap into the basic public services,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
basically according to their permanent residence.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In the past, we have seen China trying to push forward the household registration reform, but we've limited success.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So what makes it different this time?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
First of all, there's a real intention that they need to stabilize the real estate problem.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And there is sufficient demand if urbanization can continue and rural population can be properly integrated into the formal economy.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But also, I still think that there are challenges because local governments, they operate in their own kind of autonomous sort of way,
