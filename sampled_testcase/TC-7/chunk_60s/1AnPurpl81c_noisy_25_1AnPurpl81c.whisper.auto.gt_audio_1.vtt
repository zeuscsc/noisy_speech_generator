00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So when these non-English speakers were introduced to Standard English, they influenced English with their own native languages, molding it into what we know today as Singlish.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Like any other language, Singlish has its own sets of rules and vocabulary.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You can use Singlish to get your points across faster with lesser words.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For example, in Standard English you would say,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Seems like it is going to rain today. I think it would be best for you to bring an umbrella out.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Which comes to a total of 21 words.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Whereas, when you use Singlish, you could say,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Like gonna rain now, bring an umbrella la.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That's only 7 words.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Another interesting example is the Singlish word la that originates from its Chinese counterpart.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
La is very versatile and can be used for many different contexts.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For example, you can say,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Sorry la, to make your apology sound less formal.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If you want to blame someone, you could say,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
All your fault la, where the la emphasizes your anger.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You can also use la to reassure someone by saying,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Don't worry, can fix one la.
