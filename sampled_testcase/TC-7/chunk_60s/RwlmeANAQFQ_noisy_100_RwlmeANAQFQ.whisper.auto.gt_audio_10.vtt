00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
then they can pretty much choose wherever their kids go to school.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So it's also a big step for Chinese government to start subsidizing the child care and maybe elderly care as well.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, I think that's the right thing to do. I think that China has to learn from other countries that have been relatively successful in raising fertility.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And obviously providing child care services, obviously, gives more freedom to the working women of the household.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And this is the kind of social services that will not only stimulate things like fertility, but also free up some resources for demand.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So I think lots of lessons to be learned from those countries.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What type of a structural reform would be necessary in order to push China to make those changes?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Like in the past, probably if one city government managed to invite more manufacturers to set shopping in their place,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
then they actually get rewarded by tax and many other things. So what needs to be changed?
