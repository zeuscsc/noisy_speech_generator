00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
axis, all right? Now you have this grid. Think of this grid as a map, okay? This think of this grid as a map

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.120
where only few data points we have sampled, okay? We want to trace the lines in this map. Say you, you have

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.440
a particular country and you want to trace the lines and the lines where the lines are the lines

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.680
are the points where your objective function, the objective function is highest. So higher the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.520
objective function, suppose if it's accuracy, we want to maximize it, right? Suppose your objective is

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:37.520
increasing the accuracy. We want to go in a in a particular route that will reach us to the maximum.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.320
Suppose this is the point where it has the maximum highest accuracy starting somewhere randomly.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.400
We want to reach this point at the fastest rate, right? The acquisition function, the acquisition

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.480
function is something that will, that will estimate the height of these points, okay?

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.400
Think of this as a contour. You might have seen contour graphs and all where you have say red colors,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.880
dark red colors, wherever the point is very high. The, the value is very high heat maps kind of thing,
