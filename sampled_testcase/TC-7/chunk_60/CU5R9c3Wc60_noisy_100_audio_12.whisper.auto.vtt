00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.560
hyper parameter optimization, we define the objective function. This is the key. This is

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.280
the main part where you define what the hyper parameters are. So you are passing it into a

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.480
dictionary. Okay. Hyper parameters and what could be the potential values each of these parameters

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.600
could take. Okay. Depending on what the nature of the values are here, these are integers. So trial

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.520
dot suggestant. Okay. This trial is the object that we are passing to the objective itself.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.720
Then we will train the, train the random forest classifier, fit it. That is, this is the training

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.160
part itself. Then get the predicted values and compute the accuracy score. And we are returning

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.320
the accuracy score. This is the objective function. Now, once that is done, we are ready to create a study

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.400
that we are using the optuna. This is present as a method inside optuna object itself. And since we

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.520
are using accuracy, we are setting the direction as maximize. Okay. So the study is created.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.080
They've called study dot optimize. The number of trials we are setting as 100. You can increase

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.360
this number if you have more computation power and patience. All right. So this is the, we are printing

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.120
out the, the number of trials it took, the best parameters and the trial value itself. So I have
