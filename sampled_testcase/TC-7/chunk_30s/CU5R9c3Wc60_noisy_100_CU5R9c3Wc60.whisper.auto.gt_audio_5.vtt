of hyper parameters, both one and two randomly we pick. Here they are equally spaced usually typically

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.160
equally play equally spaced or discrete values of hyper parameters. We choose specific values of hyper

parameter two also. So it is always a combination of this and this. Whereas here, since we are randomly

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.640
picking it, these points can be anywhere. This may not be in a grid. Because these points are can is

randomly chosen between hyper parameters one and two. We get the model here gets to see various
