Here's a preview.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.760
Next week there will be a mysterious guest who I have watched for

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.920
four or five years. He will come

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.720
up to chat.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.720
It turns out that everyone

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.720
has their own way of using credit cards. Would

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.720
modern people not be able to survive without credit cards?

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.720

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.520
I am very proud of the content. Remember to pay

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.920
