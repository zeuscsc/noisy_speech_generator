to prove that an institution is worthy of lending you money.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.640

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.440
But if this credit card does

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.040

will be difficult to help you.

If you need to, go watch this episode to review.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.280
Seeing this proves that you

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.280
are very concerned about your money.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.640
But if you feel that the investment world

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.320
seems to be a maze full of fog, and you have to

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.520
