00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:58.000
function acquisition function will decide what route to take in order to reach the optimal point. So this is the

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.520
fundamental idea behind Bayesian optimization. Let's implement this in code. Okay. So we will see a couple

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:11.360
of implementations of hyper parameter optimization. One is using the optuna package. The other is using
