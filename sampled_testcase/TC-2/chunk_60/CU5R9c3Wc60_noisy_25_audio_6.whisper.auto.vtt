00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.400
model score given a particular configuration of the hyper parameters? So this is ultimately what we want

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:12.400
to find out. But we want to find this. We want to find the configuration that gives the maximum or minimum

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.000
depending on the objective, giving the what is the configuration that gives the maximum model score.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.280
But at the same time, we don't have the liberty of trying out

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.080
all of these iterations, all of these configurations possible, right? The number of iterations or the

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.880
number of iterations means training here. Each training process is what we refer to as iteration.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.040
The number of iterations is something that we want to reduce. So we want to achieve this

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:46.160
objective with minimum number of iterations. How do we do this? This essentially boils down into four

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.680
steps. First, we need a surrogate model. Surrogate model is nothing but the model where we predict the

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.960
model score or the objective function, whatever we want to call it. So predict the objective function

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.720
given a particular configuration of hyper parameters, right? So we will have a surrogate
