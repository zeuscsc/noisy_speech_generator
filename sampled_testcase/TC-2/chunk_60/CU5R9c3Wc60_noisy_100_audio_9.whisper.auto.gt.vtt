00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.200
iterations that the user has set has been achieved. So this is the whole idea behind it. If you want

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:11.120
to understand simply rights, if you want to understand simply what surrogate function versus surrogate

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.040
function versus a acquisition function does is simply say this is your grid. This is your hyper

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:23.440
parameter, hyper parameter grid. Say you have the hyper parameter one and hyper parameter two on the y

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:30.320
axis, all right? Now you have this grid. Think of this grid as a map, okay? This think of this grid as a map

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:36.560
where only few data points we have sampled, okay? We want to trace the lines in this map. Say you, you have

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.880
a particular country and you want to trace the lines and the lines where the lines are the lines

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:49.120
are the points where your objective function, the objective function is highest. So higher the

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.960
objective function, suppose if it's accuracy, we want to maximize it, right? Suppose your objective is

00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:00.960
increasing the accuracy. We want to go in a in a particular route that will reach us to the maximum.
