Hi, I'm Selva Prabhakaran. In this one, let's understand clearly the Bayesian optimization

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.920
method for hyper parameter tuning. Now, you know, hyper parameter tuning is a key step in

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.800
machine learning model building, but it can be quite time taking. So we will understand

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.760
everything about Bayesian optimization specifically. Okay. But to be clear, let's quickly revise

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.540
what is hyper parameter tuning in the first place so that everything will make sense and

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.880
fall in place. This is how machine learning model building happens. Say you have the features and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.220
the variable that you want to predict X and Y respectively. This you have in your data,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.080
the data is split into training data set on which the model will be actually trained. Then you will

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.900
do the prediction on validation data set, which has not been shown to the model during training,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.520
right? So you will do the prediction. So X and Y from the train is passed to the ML model. This is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.640
the training process. Okay. You get the predictions on the validation data set, the Y hat. Then you

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.640
compare the Y hat against the actual Y from the validation data set. From that you compute the
