00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
But at the same time, we don't have the liberty of trying out

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.080
all of these iterations, all of these configurations possible, right? The number of iterations or the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.880
number of iterations means training here. Each training process is what we refer to as iteration.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.040
The number of iterations is something that we want to reduce. So we want to achieve this

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:28.160
objective with minimum number of iterations. How do we do this? This essentially boils down into four

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.680
steps. First, we need a surrogate model. Surrogate model is nothing but the model where we predict the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.960
model score or the objective function, whatever we want to call it. So predict the objective function

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.720
given a particular configuration of hyper parameters, right? So we will have a surrogate

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.400
model. At the same time, we cannot estimate this for all possible combinations or all possible

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.760
configurations, right? We want to minimize the number of iterations. So we need an acquisition

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.960
function also. So this acquisition function will guide the search. Guide the search means if you
