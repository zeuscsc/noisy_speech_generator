00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
to try to get this and try it out. First, we will import the packages optuna numpy pandas.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.440
And from scikit-learn, we are going to be using the breast cancer data set. And we will also use

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.720
these also. All right. So basic steps. First, we will download the data, load the data set, which is

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.800
the breast cancer data set. We get the X, the features and the Y form the use strain test split to form

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.400
your X-train, X-validation, Y-train and Y-validation. Basic steps. Now, in order to do the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.040
hyper parameter optimization, we define the objective function. This is the key. This is

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.760
the main part where you define what the hyper parameters are. So you are passing it into a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.960
dictionary. Okay. Hyper parameters and what could be the potential values each of these parameters

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.080
could take. Okay. Depending on what the nature of the values are here, these are integers. So trial

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.000
dot suggestion. Okay. This trial is the object that we are passing to the objective itself.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.200
Then we will train the, train the random forest classifier, fit it. That is, this is the training

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.640
part itself. Then get the predicted values and compute the accuracy score. And we are returning
