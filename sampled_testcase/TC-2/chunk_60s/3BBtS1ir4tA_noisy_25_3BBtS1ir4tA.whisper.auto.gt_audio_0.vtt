Hey there Spy there! This is your boy Mikey Bustos.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.920
This video is an in-depth tutorial of the Filipino accent.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.040
The first thing to know is there are no F sounds.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.520
Follow, Flip, Fact, Filipino, Philippines, Family, Snowflake.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.880
No B sounds.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.000
Victory, Van, Veno, Living La vida Loca, Golden Retriever.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.160
Blog and vlog sound the same.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.920
The lack of B probably comes from the Spanish influence

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.920
when the Spaniards invaded Philippines in the 1500s.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.200
That is why many of us Philippine have Spanish last names like Bustos.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.680
My full name is Michael John Yadan Tumanguil Pestano Bustos.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.440
Try saying that 5 times.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.080
Also worth noting, there's no TH.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.760
It's either D sound like that, this, there, them, breathe,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.600
or T sound like thick, teeth, beneath, thistle, breath.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.200
Also, another thing to note is that the Filipino language

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.240
lacks he  she, she distinct pronouns.
