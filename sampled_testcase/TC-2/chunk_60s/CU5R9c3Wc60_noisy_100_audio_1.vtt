00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
error, which is called the validation error, right? We want this error to be as low as possible. In

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.700
order to achieve that, one of the techniques is we try to see how the model is performing. That is

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.500
the error. Performance is lower the error, better the performances. Now we try to adjust various

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.580
combinations of the hyper parameters of whichever ML model that we are dealing with. For example,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.200
if we are dealing with say a random forest algorithm, the hyper parameter could be something

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.080
like the number of estimators and say the max depth, right? And could be other parameters also.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.140
Likewise, if you use say support vector missions, it could be what kernel you are using, what kernel

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.000
you are using, what the value of the C parameters, things like that, right? So for a specific value

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.640
of these hyper parameters, the error might be lowest. This is what hyper parameter tuning is

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.920
all about. Now the process of hyper parameter tuning itself is done using the most common method is using

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.600
what is called the grid search. For example, you have two hyper parameters, hyper parameter one and
