parameters. We are defining the bounds and call GPyOpt dot methods Bayesian optimization. We pass the

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.400
objective function bounds and acquisition function type equal to ei expected improvement. You could also

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.280
try the other options, especially the UCB option, which could also work well. Now, once that is done,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.480
we run the optimization, then get the best parameters, convert to integer values, and then

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.360
you can get the best parameter values. Now, once the best parameters values are estimated,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.600
we need to sort of rebuild the model again. That is the random forest classifier with the best

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.960
parameters that we have found out. After building that, you can do the train test split, fit the model

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.760
and get the best predictions. So this is the code quite straightforward. Use the link in the

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.760
description to try this out on your own.
