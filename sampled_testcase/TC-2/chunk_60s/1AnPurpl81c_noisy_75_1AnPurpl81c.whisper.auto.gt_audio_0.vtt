00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In the United Kingdom, there's British English, and in the United States, there's American English.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In Singapore, we have Singaporean English, or more commonly known as Singlish.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You can usually hear Singlish used for informal conversations and might be confused by its different standards of English.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So how exactly is Singlish different from British and American English?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And what do all the lah, leh and lor represent?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Singlish started when Singapore became an independent nation and introduced English into their country.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
As a former colony of britain, Singapore used British English as their official language for their administrations.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If you were a Singaporean at that time, it would be the first time you would have proper classes and learn about the ABCs.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But back then, there was only a minority group of elites who were proficient in English.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The rest of Singapore's population consisted of the Chinese, Malays, and Indians, who were former migrants and only spoke their own native languages.
