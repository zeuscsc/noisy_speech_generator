this area, isn't it? Because this is green, this is doing well, right? Because this area is doing

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.520
well, we will try and find out for this particular region for the best possible parameter combination.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.560
But we don't take that information account when into account when we are using grid search as well

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.840
as random search. So this is exactly what Bayesian optimization is all about. It tries to make use

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.000
of the prior information to make the subsequent searches so that we will be able to find the optimal point

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.960
quite fast. So this is the fundamental idea behind Bayesian optimization. But how does this work?
