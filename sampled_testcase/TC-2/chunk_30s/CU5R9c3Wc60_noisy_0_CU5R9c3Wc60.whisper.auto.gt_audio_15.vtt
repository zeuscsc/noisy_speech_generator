00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
or the upper confidence bound method you can use to use as the acquisition function. So this will

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:15.120
essentially guide how the model or how the algorithm is searching for the next iterate next configuration

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.400
of the hyper parameter. So once the next iteration or configuration is chosen, we will use again

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.160
the surrogate model in this step to evaluate the newly chosen configuration, right? So we will evaluate it

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.800
find the score again score or the objective function again and then use that newly found information
