00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
the main part where you define what the hyper parameters are. So you are passing it into a

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.920
dictionary. Okay. Hyper parameters and what could be the potential values each of these parameters

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.040
could take. Okay. Depending on what the nature of the values are here, these are integers. So trial

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.960
dot suggestion. Okay. This trial is the object that we are passing to the objective itself.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.160
Then we will train the, train the random forest classifier, fit it. That is, this is the training

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.600
part itself. Then get the predicted values and compute the accuracy score. And we are returning

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.760
the accuracy score. This is the objective function. Now, once that is done, we are ready to create a study
