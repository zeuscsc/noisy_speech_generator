try the other options, especially the UCB option, which could also work well. Now, once that is done,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.080
we run the optimization, then get the best parameters, convert to integer values, and then

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.960
you can get the best parameter values. Now, once the best parameters values are estimated,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.200
we need to sort of rebuild the model again. That is the random forest classifier with the best

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.560
parameters that we have found out. After building that, you can do the train test split, fit the model

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.360
and get the best predictions. So this is the code quite straightforward. Use the link in the
