These are the main part where you define what the hyperparameters are. So you are passing it into a dictionary, okay, hyperparameters. And what would be the potential values? Each of these parameters could take, okay? Depending on what the natural devices are. Yeah, these are integers. So trial dot suggestion. Okay, this trial is the object that we are passing through the objective itself. Then we will train the Train, the random forest classifier with it. This is the training part itself, then get the predicted values and compute the accuracy score and we are returning the accuracy score. This is the update, the function. Now once that is done, we are ready to create a study
