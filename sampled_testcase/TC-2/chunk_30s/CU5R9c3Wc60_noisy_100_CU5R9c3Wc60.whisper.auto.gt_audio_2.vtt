00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
order to achieve that, one of the techniques is we try to see how the model is performing. That is

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.040
the error. Performance is lower the error, better the performances. Now we try to adjust various

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.120
combinations of the hyper parameters of whichever ML model that we are dealing with. For example,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.740
if we are dealing with say a random forest algorithm, the hyper parameter could be something

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.620
like the number of estimators and say the max depth, right? And could be other parameters also.
