00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
configurations, right? We want to minimize the number of iterations. So we need an acquisition

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.560
function also. So this acquisition function will guide the search. Guide the search means if you

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.280
are familiar with the concept of reinforcement learning, if you are familiar with reinforcement

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.160
learning with the idea behind say multi-arm bandits and all this is quite similar to that

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.880
where this acquisition function will have the opportunity to explore either explore or exploit.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.600
Exploit means what it means is basically we know that these regions are doing well. If we know that
