number of iterations means training here. Each training process is what we refer to as iteration.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.040
The number of iterations is something that we want to reduce. So we want to achieve this

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:46.160
objective with minimum number of iterations. How do we do this? This essentially boils down into four

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.680
steps. First, we need a surrogate model. Surrogate model is nothing but the model where we predict the

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.960
model score or the objective function, whatever we want to call it. So predict the objective function

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.720
given a particular configuration of hyper parameters, right? So we will have a surrogate
