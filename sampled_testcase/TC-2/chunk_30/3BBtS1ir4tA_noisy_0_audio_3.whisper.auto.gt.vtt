Kuya, germs!

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.840
Hindi ah!

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.200
nako, dandruff!

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.400

70 pesos lang.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.360
People ask me why I am able to speak like this.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.640
And I tell them, even though I was born in Canada,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.680
I used to speak like this when I was very small.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.760
I learned English from my parents.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.320
Pero, but, in grade 4, I learned to speak with a proper accent

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.360
so that I could fit in and the kids wouldn't make fun of me.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.680
But, I never lost it.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.200
Anyway, there are 171 native languages in Philippines.
