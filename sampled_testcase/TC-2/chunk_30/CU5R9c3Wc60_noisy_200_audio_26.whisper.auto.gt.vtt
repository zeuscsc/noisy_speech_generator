00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.120
out the, the number of trials it took, the best parameters and the trial value itself. So I have

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:12.720
already run this code and you can see it has run for about 100 different iterations. And at the end,

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:19.440
you get an accuracy of 0.9649. Okay. So this is the best performance. So once the model is, once the

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.880
training is done, the search is done, we use the best parameters. So from study, get the best trial

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.920
and the parameters from that trail and rebuild this model. Okay. We have to retrain this model using the

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.280
best parameters and then you can do the prediction also. So this is based on the optuna packaging.
