relationship between the error and

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.070 align:start position:0%
relationship between the error and

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
opening of the wall

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.470 align:start position:0%
opening of the wall

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
i call this as proportional action

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.149 align:start position:0%
i call this as proportional action

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
the opening of the wall depends on how

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
the opening of the wall depends on how

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
much is the error

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.229 align:start position:0%
much is the error

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
that is the proportionality i am talking

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.990 align:start position:0%
that is the proportionality i am talking
about

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 align:start position:0%

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
this opening of the wall i call it as

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.150 align:start position:0%
this opening of the wall i call it as
corrective<00:04:16.479><c> action</c>

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
corrective action

now when i have a proportionality

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.670 align:start position:0%

you<00:04:21.840><c> can</c><00:04:22.000><c> observe</c><00:04:22.240><c> that</c><00:04:22.400><c> it</c><00:04:22.479><c> will</c><00:04:22.560><c> happen</c><00:04:22.960><c> only</c>

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
you can observe that it will happen only

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.590 align:start position:0%
you can observe that it will happen only

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
after the error has happened that means

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.670 align:start position:0%
after the error has happened that means
this<00:04:25.759><c> valve</c><00:04:26.000><c> will</c><00:04:26.240><c> commence</c><00:04:26.639><c> opening</c><00:04:27.280><c> or</c>

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
this valve will commence opening or
