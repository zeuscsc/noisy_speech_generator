And also the 300 million migrant workers, you know, they have even with the same income as an urban worker,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
they spend only one third of that equivalent of a consumption of urban worker.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So this is the focus of the current government.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So I want to follow up on that.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Actually, this sounds like a very ambitious plan.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
When we look at that, there's a mention of in the future, the migrant workers and their families can tap into the basic public services,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
basically according to their permanent residence.
