00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Because of the deepseek, because of the potential of integrating AI into their production.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Actually, deepseek caught the world by surprise.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But I don't think it caught China by that much of a surprise.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Of course, Chinese people were thrilled because, hey, look, it will happen to these export controls and tech restrictions.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
They're able to make these major achievements.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Because if we look in live in China, observe that the daily lives, innovation is happening here and there all the time.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Breakthroughs, small and large are at every level.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So that's something to keep in mind.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And it does permeate throughout the economy.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The interesting thing is that I don't think this is head-on competition with the US.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
US does these breakthroughs, more systematic model-based.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The Chinese applications are really, really useful.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Because ultimately, the success of the technology and how much it actually impacts the economy depends on how much it's adopted, how accessible it is, and how much it permeates throughout society and everyday lives.
