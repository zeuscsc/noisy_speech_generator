So you see that? There's still a lot of controls in place in China, even in the first tier cities and property and the social infrastructure.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And if you loosen them, there will be a proper rebound of domestic demand.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Yeah, mentioning about the school choice, just remind me of another city, the capital city of Inner Mongolia,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
which actually roll out these subsidies for child care, including if a family have three children,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
then they can pretty much choose wherever their kids go to school.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So it's also a big step for Chinese government to start subsidizing the child care and maybe elderly care as well.
