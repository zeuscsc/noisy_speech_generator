00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.880
fourth quarter of 2023,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.040
Hong Kong people used a total of 160 billion credit cards.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.120

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.200

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.680
What is the price behind the freedom that credit cards seem to give us?

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.720
In fact, it turns out that many people still don't know the operating principle of

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.800
this card that has been in their wallets for decades.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.200

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.520
So we interviewed our colleagues

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.480
to see how much they know about credit cards. They

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.200
use credit cards a lot,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.240
but do they know how credit cards make money?

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.160
Merchants charge fees.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.320
I guess they make

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.840
money from people who can't pay back their debts.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.840
In addition, they make money from merchants' cooperation fees.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.360
It seems that my colleagues don't know much about credit cards.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.720
Fortunately,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.080
to understand the operating mechanism of credit cards, it's nothing more

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.960
than one word,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.280
"trust", which

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.560
is credit in English.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.520
In the financial world, there are generally two types of people.
