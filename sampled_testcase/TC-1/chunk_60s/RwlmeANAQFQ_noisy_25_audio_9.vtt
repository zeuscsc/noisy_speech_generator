00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
like any other government they care about social stability.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Maybe this is very politically incorrect to mention this, but it's kind of like the immigration issue, right?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
When you have lots of people coming into their jurisdiction, what do they do about local employment and jobs and stability and so forth?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So I think there are some challenges, but one example is in Tianjin, they want to obviously stabilize the real estate sector.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So one policy they proposed was, well, anyone who buys a property here can have access to local schools.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That will stimulate a lot of demand.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So you see that? There's still a lot of controls in place in China, even in the first tier cities and property and the social infrastructure.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And if you loosen them, there will be a proper rebound of domestic demand.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Yeah, mentioning about the school choice, just remind me of another city, the capital city of Inner Mongolia,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
which actually roll out these subsidies for child care, including if a family have three children,
