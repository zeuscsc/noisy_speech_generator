00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
where developing countries could also manufacture things as well.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yeah, this kind of resemble what Japan did in the last century.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Japan ramped up the outbounded direct investment after a plaza called,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and then as an alternative to the export.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Do you think China will kind of looking to that kind of solution?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I don't see where it could be a substitute for exports

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because you know investment abroad is obviously buying assets globally,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which is good for diversification of Chinese wealth, but it has a very different implication

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
from Chinese suppliers and Chinese companies being able to sell to the rest of the world.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But one thing that we do need to keep in mind is that China is actually looking more and more like a big and rich country.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So if you look at its export share of GDP, it's actually falling over time and converging to the US and Europe,
