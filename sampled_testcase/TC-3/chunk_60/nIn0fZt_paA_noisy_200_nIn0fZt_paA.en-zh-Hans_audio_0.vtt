00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
Why is it that some people use the same credit card

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.840
well while

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.760
others end up with huge debts?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.400
But donâ€™t you feel bad if you really paid more money for nothing

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.360
?

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.560
Normal people would think, "

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.480
I paid more for this purchase." Right,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.120

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.280
then I won't do that.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.480
But you didn't get nothing.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.080
You gained time.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.760
Wow,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.760
it's amazing.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.160
Your idea is really interesting. I've

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.080
never seen anything like this.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.720
No matter how you use it, the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.800
birth of credit cards can be said to be a conspiracy. In

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.040
our daily lives, we

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.800
have actually fallen into the trap when we use

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.880
credit cards to make purchases. But even when faced with the traps set by credit card companies,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.960

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.320
we have ways

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.720
to crack the merchants' tricks.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.040
I believe everyone has a card in hand.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.040
No matter how good your investment is, the

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.120
wrong use of credit cards

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.920
can destroy the wealth you have worked hard to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.720
build. In

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.280
this episode, let's talk about the price

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.360
behind the convenience of credit cards.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.960

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.320

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.080
How do credit card companies with endless discounts make money from us?
