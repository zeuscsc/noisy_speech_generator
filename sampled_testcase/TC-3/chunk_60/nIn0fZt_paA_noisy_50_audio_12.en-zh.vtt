00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.840
to prove that an institution is worthy of lending you money.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.640

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.440
But if this credit card has

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.040
no credit score, it

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.240
will be difficult to help you.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.600
So the credit score system

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.440
is a double-edged sword. It

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.640
depends on how you use it.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.040
Good debt and bad debt

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:13.680

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.760
have been discussed in detail in this episode of Borrowing Money for a Lifetime.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.440
If you need to, go watch this episode to review it.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.280
Seeing this all proves that you are very concerned about your

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.280
money.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.640
But if you feel that the investment world

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.320
seems to be a maze full of fog, you will have to

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.520

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.320
read many, many books

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.200
before you find ten or eight books that are useful. It seems that you are out for

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.160
food, and you are destined to

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.560
lose a lot of money before you learn anything. If it

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.840
makes your scalp numb,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.760
donâ€™t worry.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.040
In order to help everyone get out of this investment maze,

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.360
we have just carefully prepared

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.120
a series of new learning routes that are easy to learn and easy to understand.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.760
If you want to be on the road to investment and financial management.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.160
Go longer and further. Go

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.800
