00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.000
debt is a good debt or a bad debt.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.960
Rich people are bound to have debts.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.080
They will borrow money to do things that will increase in value,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.880
buy things that will appreciate in value,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.280
or assets that will bring positive cash flow.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.080
If you pay back 1 yuan

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.480
but your income can create 2 yuan, then

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.680
achieving unlimited leverage

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.280
will only help you accumulate wealth slowly and slowly, and slowly

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.880
snowball.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.240
For example, using a good credit card repayment record to

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.880
improve your credit score, the

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.480
first thing everyone should know is that

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.600
a healthy credit record

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.920
means not using more than 30% of the credit limit

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.520
and repaying on time every month.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.760
Credit score may not be of much use to you today,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.320

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.080
but if you

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.520
plan to do a mortgage or do business in the future and suddenly

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.400
need

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.520
money to turn around,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.120
how much you can borrow, what the interest rate is,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.720
or even whether you can borrow at all?

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.040
Credit score is absolutely the key role  There is more than one way

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.840
to prove that an institution is worthy of lending you money.
