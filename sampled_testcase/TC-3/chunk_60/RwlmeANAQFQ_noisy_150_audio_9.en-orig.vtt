what do they do about local employment

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.750 align:start position:0%
what do they do about local employment

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
and jobs and stability and so forth? So,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.389 align:start position:0%
and jobs and stability and so forth? So,
I<00:09:41.920><c> think</c><00:09:42.000><c> there's</c><00:09:42.320><c> some</c><00:09:42.480><c> challenges,</c><00:09:43.080><c> but</c><00:09:44.080><c> one</c>

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
I think there's some challenges, but one

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:48.070 align:start position:0%
I think there's some challenges, but one
example<00:09:44.720><c> is</c><00:09:45.040><c> in</c><00:09:45.200><c> Tangin,</c><00:09:46.160><c> they</c><00:09:46.480><c> want</c><00:09:46.720><c> to</c><00:09:47.519><c> um</c>

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
example is in Tangin, they want to um

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.070 align:start position:0%
example is in Tangin, they want to um
obviously<00:09:49.040><c> stabilize</c><00:09:49.519><c> the</c><00:09:49.680><c> real</c><00:09:49.839><c> estate</c>

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
obviously stabilize the real estate

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.310 align:start position:0%
obviously stabilize the real estate
sector.<00:09:50.320><c> So</c><00:09:50.560><c> one</c><00:09:50.720><c> policy</c><00:09:51.040><c> they</c><00:09:51.360><c> proposed</c><00:09:51.760><c> was</c>

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
sector. So one policy they proposed was

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.110 align:start position:0%
sector. So one policy they proposed was
well<00:09:52.640><c> anyone</c><00:09:52.880><c> who</c><00:09:53.120><c> buys</c><00:09:53.760><c> a</c><00:09:54.080><c> property</c><00:09:54.399><c> here</c><00:09:54.800><c> can</c>

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
stimulate a lot of demand. So you see
