00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And Chinese applications and Chinese technology are very much suited for that.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Because I think the approach of Chinese innovators, first start from trying to address a problem, solve a problem.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And if we look at much of the developing world, it really isn't about access to advanced technologies that matters.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But it's really about adoptability.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Very interesting.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Since you mentioned about the US-China rivalry, maybe we can end with that question.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So do you think it's still possible for China and US to reach a deal? What would the deal look like?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You know, it's very interesting that Mr. Trump or President Trump his view of China seems to be evolving over time.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We don't really know, but I think that in terms of competition, it's always going to be there.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
US and Japan competition was quite ferocious in major tech sectors, but it really pushed US to improve.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
US to spend a lot more on its innovation system and reform its innovation system.
