00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Also start to talk about sector-specific measures in order to cut the capacity.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And as you said, it may be restrict the export.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Does the outbound of the Iraq investment also play a role?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I think outbound direct investment is very much encouraged by the rest of the world,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
well, with the exception of countries that don't welcome Chinese money, which is, I think, is not not smart.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But, you know, that's the fact.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If you look at around the developing world, actually, in the world today, there's a massive deficit in investment.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Agri-investment in the world is down, especially to developing countries.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And some countries needs to fill that gap.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I think China is very just doing so by not only investing, but maybe bringing some of its technology,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but it really need to obviously help the local economy build its own economy on its own feet.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And so, I think that should continue. That's a very different set of issues from exporting goods
