I think still lots of people are not paying taxes and direct income taxes is not very strong as a redistributionary force.

A lot of the wealthy people are not really paying very high tax rates. It's actually in the end a bit regressive given that the tax system relies a lot of us at a global issue.

It is a global issue, but China is not going to escape from that.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But actually Chinese taxation is more regressive than in many other advanced economies.

But again, coming back to the social protection, social insurance, once people think that they have sustained rising wages and employment security,

because the property sector really went beyond property, unlike in other countries, which all had their ups and downs in property,
