00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And I keep on having to remind the Western audience that this isn't what always happens when you predict China like that,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
going from collapse, oops, second edition collapse, oops, no, third edition, then peak China.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Oh, and then deepseek, and suddenly everybody's interested in China again, right?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yeah, nobody's talking about China is uninvestable.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Not anymore. And that was a major thing.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
More clients are asking me about what's going on in China, what kind of the next deepseek moment will be.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Exactly. So this is what I've been trying to argue that China's fundamentals are there.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
China's long-term potential is there. Just look at the people, the skills, the hard work, the scale, the market, the innovation.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Yes, in a short-term confidence has been the major hindrance to the Chinese economic situation.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But that's also very hard to rebuild, of course, but the fundamentals are there.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's a very different country from just the normal countries that form to the middle-income trap.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Yeah, indeed. I think nobody would expect all of us on the tech companies and other type of companies are interested in increase the capex.
