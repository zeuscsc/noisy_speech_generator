00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.400
First, count how many credit cards you have.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400
Do you know

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.600
how much your total credit limit is?

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.200
Second, after looking at the credit card monthly statement for the most recent month,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.800
what are your spending habits? Do you

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.200
have any outstanding balances?

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.600
I believe there will be surprises.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.800
Third, what was the reason for applying for different credit cards in the first place? Is

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.600

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.400
this reason still valid? Do you

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.200
need to cancel the card? After

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.800
doing your homework,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.720
you are welcome to
