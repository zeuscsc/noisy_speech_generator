00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.280
maintain a long-term debt status. I

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.520
just mentioned this group of people  It accounts for a

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.720
considerable proportion of the entire society.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.880
Once the interest compounding model is started, the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.880
bank's income can be terrifyingly

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.880
considerable. How terrifying is it?

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.160
Let's make an assumption first.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.840
Suppose you swipe your card to buy an

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.960
Apple Vision Pro worth 27,000 yuan.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.040
From the day you consume it, you are already borrowing money from the bank.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.840
As long as you pay late

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.840
or only pay the minimum repayment every month,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.200
what are the consequences? Interest

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.040
has been accrued since the date of transaction.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.920
If it continues to compound day after day,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.560
interest on interest must also be calculated.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.920
Within a few years, the

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.040
interest you pay will be more than the

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.040
amount you actually swipe the card.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.400
Looking at this HSBC credit card counter, it

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.040
will be clear.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.280
Using 27,000 yuan to

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.760
buy an Apple Vision Pro,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.560
as long as you pay the minimum repayment, it will take 14 years to

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.360
pay off the amount. The
