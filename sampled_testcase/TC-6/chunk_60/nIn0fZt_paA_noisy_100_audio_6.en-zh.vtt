00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.280
maintain a long-term debt status. The group of people I

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.520
just mentioned accounts for a

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.720
large proportion of the entire society.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.880
Once the interest-based model is activated, the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.880
bank's income can be terrifyingly considerable.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.880
How terrifying is it? Let's

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.160
make an assumption.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.840
Suppose you swipe your card to buy a worth  The day you spend $

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.960
27,000 on an Apple Vision Pro,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.040
you are already borrowing money from the bank. What will happen

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.840
if you are late with your payments

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.840
or only pay the minimum amount every month?

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.200
Interest

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.040
will start to accrue from the day you sign the contract, and

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.920
if it continues day after day, you will also have to

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.560
pay interest on interest.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.920
In a few years, the

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.040
interest you pay will be

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.040
more than the amount you paid on your card. A

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.400
look at HSBC's credit card counter

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.040
will show you everything. If you spend $

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.280
27,000 to

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.760
buy an Apple Vision Pro, it will

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.560
take you 14 years to

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.360
pay off the
