As shown, Singlish has a different standard of English,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
making it difficult for the rest of the world to understand.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This brought the attention of the government,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
as Singlish had decreased the country's overall English standards.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
They were concerned Singlish would hinder Singapore's economic development.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So the government launched the Speak Good English movement

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
to try and improve English standards and eliminate Singlish.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The campaign, however, was not well received by some Singaporeans.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
As Singlish helped them to maintain solidarity and friendships among themselves,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
supporters felt that he has become a national identity and should not be abolished.
