percentage of people pay on time? They are

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.800
overpaid.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.960
Fortunately, we also have the habit of using credit cards.  They are

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.800
all relatively healthy.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.000
If you want to know what kind of traps they have been in and what

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.440
I think of their card swiping habits,

but some are so funny.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.600

Credit cards are evil,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.600
but for many people, they

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.400

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.000
Keep at least two or three in your wallet just in case,
