Hey there Spy there! This is your boy Mikey Bustos.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.240
This video is an in-depth tutorial of the Filipino accent.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.360
The first thing to know is there are no F sounds.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.840
Follow, Flip, Fact, Filipino, Philippines, Family, Snowflake.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.200
No B sounds.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.320
Victory, Van, Veno, Living La vida Loca, Golden Retriever.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.480
Blog and vlog sound the same.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.240
The lack of B probably comes from the Spanish influence

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.240
when the Spaniards invaded Philippines in the 1500s.
