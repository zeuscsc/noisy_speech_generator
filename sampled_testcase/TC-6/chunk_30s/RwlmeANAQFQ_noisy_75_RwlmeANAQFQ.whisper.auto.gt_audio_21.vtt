And what is the relationship between local and central government?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Local governments still have the burden of taking up the majority of the expenditure and the social and the local economy,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but it obviously relied in the past a lot on land sales and real estate as a source of revenue.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And they have to ramp up a lot of debt to undertake those kind of responsibilities.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But maybe the local government, KPI, should be changed from looking at GDP growth and investment to other things.
