Now, if we dig a little bit deeper, it also stems from the tax structure, which I think there has to be performed as well,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
very narrow tax base, income tax base, but also the government is heavily reliant on indirect taxation like VAT.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So direct taxation, which helps with redistribution, is quite weak.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And then the secondary redistribution through social insurance is obviously also inadequate given that rule.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Consumers have what an average of 5% of an average pension of the urban household.
