La is very versatile and can be used for many different contexts.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For example, you can say,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Sorry la, to make your apology sound less formal.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you want to blame someone, you could say,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
All your fault la, where the la emphasizes your anger.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You can also use la to reassure someone by saying,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Don't worry, can fix one la.

As shown, Singlish has a different standard of English,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
making it difficult for the rest of the world to understand.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This brought the attention of the government,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
as Singlish had decreased the country's overall English standards.
