I went from peak China to a few months later, deepseek moment, a major pendulum swing.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I keep on having to remind the Western audience that this isn't what always happens when you predict China like that,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
going from collapse, oops, second edition collapse, oops, no, third edition, then peak China.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Oh, and then deepseek, and suddenly everybody's interested in China again, right?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Yeah, nobody's talking about China is uninvestable.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Not anymore. And that was a major thing.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
More clients are asking me about what's going on in China, what kind of the next deepseek moment will be.
