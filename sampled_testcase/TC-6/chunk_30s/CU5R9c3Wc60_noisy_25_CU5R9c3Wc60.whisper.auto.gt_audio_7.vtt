00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
are time consuming. In random search, we will never ever get to probably know the lowest value of your

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.800
hyper parameters. I mean, we have the combination of hyper parameters that is going to give you the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.160
lowest value of the errors. Also, the search space when we deal especially with grid search might be

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.080
limited. For example, we are searching for these three values of hyper parameter one,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.560
what of the optimal value lies outside these values, right? That is also a limitation when we

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.760
deal with both of these approaches. So these are drawbacks, but the biggest drawback with both of

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.840
these approaches is this. Now, let's say here the red points and the green points are the points that
