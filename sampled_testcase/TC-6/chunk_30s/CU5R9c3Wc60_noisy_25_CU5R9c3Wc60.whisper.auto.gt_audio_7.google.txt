This is our time-consuming in random search. We will never ever get to probably know the lowest value of your hyperparameters. I mean, we have the combination of hyperparameters that is going to give you the lowest value of the errors. Also, these search space when we deal especially with grid, search might be limited. For example, we are searching for these 3 values of hyperparameter 1. What of the optimal value lies outside these values, right? That is also a limitation when we deal with both of these approaches. So these are drawbacks, but the biggest drop back with both of these approaches is this. Now let's say here the red points and the green points are the points that
