00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
the accuracy score. This is the objective function. Now, once that is done, we are ready to create a study

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.240
that we are using the optuna. This is present as a method inside optuna object itself. And since we

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.360
are using accuracy, we are setting the direction as maximize. Okay. So the study is created.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.920
They've called study dot optimize. The number of trials we are setting as 100. You can increase

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.200
this number if you have more computation power and patience. All right. So this is the, we are printing

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.960
out the, the number of trials it took, the best parameters and the trial value itself. So I have

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.560
already run this code and you can see it has run for about 100 different iterations. And at the end,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.280
you get an accuracy of 0.9649. Okay. So this is the best performance. So once the model is, once the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.720
training is done, the search is done, we use the best parameters. So from study, get the best trial

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.760
and the parameters from that trail and rebuild this model. Okay. We have to retrain this model using the

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.120
best parameters and then you can do the prediction also. So this is based on the optuna packaging.
