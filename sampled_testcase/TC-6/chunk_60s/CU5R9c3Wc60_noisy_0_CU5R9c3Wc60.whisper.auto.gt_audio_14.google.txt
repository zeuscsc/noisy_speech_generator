Parameters, we are defining the bounds and call gpop methods. Beijing optimization, we pass the objective function, bounds and acquisition function type equal, to EI, expected Improvement. You could also try the other options, especially the UCB option, which could also work. Well, now once that is done, we run the optimization, then get the best parameters convert to integer values, and then you can get the best parameter values. Now, once the best parameters values, are estimated, we need to sort of rebuild the model. Again, that is the random Forest classifier the best parameters that we have found out after building that you can do the train test split with the model and get the best predictions. So this is the code quite straightforward. Use the link in the description to try this out on your own.
