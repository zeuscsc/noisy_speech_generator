Defining the bones and call dbob. Mathers Bayesian optimization. We pass the objective function, bones and acquisition function, type equal to expect an improvement. Could also try the other options, especially the UCB option. We could also work. Well, now, what? That is done, we're on the optimization, then get the best part of M convert to Indian. If I lose and then you can get the best parameter values are estimated, we need to sort of rebuilding model again, as a pacifier. But the best we have found out after building that you can do the 2020 model and get the best predictions. So this is quite straightforward. Use the link in the description to try this out on your own.
