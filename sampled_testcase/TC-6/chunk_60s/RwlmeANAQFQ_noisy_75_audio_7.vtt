I think people's expectations about jobs and the future is not as rosy as it was before, so they want to save.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And, of course, the household balance sheet was also weakened by the real estate downturn.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
More fundamentally, it's the rural population, hundreds of millions of people still have a lack of access to social insurance and social infrastructure.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, if we dig a little bit deeper, it also stems from the tax structure, which I think there has to be performed as well,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
very narrow tax base, income tax base, but also the government is heavily reliant on indirect taxation like VAT.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So direct taxation, which helps with redistribution, is quite weak.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And then the secondary redistribution through social insurance is obviously also inadequate given that rule.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Consumers have what an average of 5% of an average pension of the urban household.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And also the 300 million migrant workers, you know, they have even with the same income as an urban worker,
